This option follows the name of the table and\nprecedes any alias declaration. The effect of this option is that rows\nare selected only from the listed partitions or subpartitions---in\nother words, any partitions or subpartitions not named in the list are\nignored For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-selection.html.\n\nThe syntax of table_factor is extended in comparison with the SQL\nStandard. The latter accepts only table_reference, not a list of them\ninside a pair of parentheses.\n\nThis is a conservative extension if we consider each comma in a list of\ntable_reference items as equivalent to an inner join. For example:\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)\n                 ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)\n                 ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)\n\nIn MySQL, JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and INNER JOIN are syntactic equivalents\n(they can replace each other). In standard SQL, they are not\nequivalent. INNER JOIN is used with an ON clause, CROSS JOIN is used\notherwise.\n\nIn general, parentheses can be ignored in join expressions containing\nonly inner join operations. MySQL also supports nested joins (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/nested-join-optimization.html).\n\nIndex hints can be specified to affect how the MySQL optimizer makes\nuse of indexes.

One session cannot acquire locks for\nanother session or release locks held by another session.\n\nLocks may be used to emulate transactions or to get more speed when\nupdating tables. This is explained in more detail later in this\nsection.\n\nLOCK TABLES explicitly acquires table locks for the current client\nsession. Table locks can be acquired for base tables or views. You must\nhave the LOCK TABLES privilege, and the SELECT privilege for each\nobject to be locked.\n\nFor view locking, LOCK TABLES adds all base tables used in the view to\nthe set of tables to be locked and locks them automatically. If you\nlock a table explicitly with LOCK TABLES, any tables used in triggers\nare also locked implicitly, as described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/lock-tables-and-triggers.html.\n\nUNLOCK TABLES explicitly releases any table locks held by the current\nsession. LOCK TABLES implicitly releases any table locks held by the\ncurrent session before acquiring new locks.\n\nAnother use for UNLOCK TABLES is to release the global read lock\nacquired with the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK statement, which enables\nyou to lock all tables in all databases. See [HELP FLUSH].

To check the number of deleted rows, call the\nROW_COUNT() function described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-functions.html.\n\nMain Clauses\n\nThe conditions in the optional WHERE clause identify which rows to\ndelete. With no WHERE clause, all rows are deleted.\n\nwhere_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to\nbe deleted. It is specified as described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html.\n\nIf the ORDER BY clause is specified, the rows are deleted in the order\nthat is specified. The LIMIT clause places a limit on the number of\nrows that can be deleted. These clauses apply to single-table deletes,\nbut not multi-table deletes.\n\nMultiple-Table Syntax\n\nDELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]\n    tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...\n    FROM table_references\n    [WHERE where_condition]\n\nOr:\n\nDELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]\n    FROM tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...\n    USING table_references\n    [WHERE where_condition]\n\nPrivileges\n\nYou need the DELETE privilege on a table to delete rows from it. You\nneed only the SELECT privilege for any columns that are only read, such\nas those named in the WHERE clause.\n\nPerformance\n\nWhen you do not need to know the number of deleted rows, the TRUNCATE\nTABLE statement is a faster way to empty a table than a DELETE\nstatement with no WHERE clause. Unlike DELETE, TRUNCATE TABLE cannot be\nused within a transaction or if you have a lock on the table. See [HELP\nTRUNCATE TABLE] and [HELP LOCK].\n\nThe speed of delete operations may also be affected by factors\ndiscussed in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete-optimization.html.\n\nTo ensure that a given DELETE statement does not take too much time,\nthe MySQL-specific LIMIT row_count clause for DELETE specifies the\nmaximum number of rows to be deleted. If the number of rows to delete\nis larger than the limit, repeat the DELETE statement until the number\nof affected rows is less than the LIMIT value.\n\nSubqueries\n\nYou cannot delete from a table and select from the same table in a\nsubquery.\n\nPartitioned Tables\n\nDELETE supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION\noption, which takes a comma-separated list of the names of one or more\npartitions or subpartitions (or both) from which to select rows to be\ndropped. Partitions not included in the list are ignored. Given a\npartitioned table t with a partition named p0, executing the statement\nDELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) has the same effect on the table as\nexecuting ALTER TABLE t TRUNCATE PARTITION (p0); in both cases, all\nrows in partition p0 are dropped.\n\nPARTITION can be used along with a WHERE condition, in which case the\ncondition is tested only on rows in the listed partitions. For example,\nDELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) WHERE c < 5 deletes rows only from\npartition p0 for which the condition c < 5 is true; rows in any other\npartitions are not checked and thus not affected by the DELETE.\n\nThe PARTITION option can also be used in multiple-table DELETE\nstatements. You can use up to one such option per table named in the\nFROM option.\n\nSee http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-selection.html,\nfor more information and examples.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html'),(36,'JSON_SEARCH',7,'JSON_SEARCH(json_doc, one_or_all, search_str[, escape_char[, path]\n...])\n\nReturns the path to the given string within a JSON document. Returns\nNULL if any of the json_doc, search_str, or path arguments are NULL; no\npath exists within the document; or search_str is not found. An error\noccurs if the json_doc argument is not a valid JSON document, any path\nargument is not a valid path expression, one_or_all is not \'one\' or\n\'all\', or escape_char is not a constant expression.\n\nThe one_or_all argument affects the search as follows:\n\no \'one\': The search terminates after the first match and returns one\n  path string. It is undefined which match is considered first.\n\no \'all\': The search returns all matching path strings such that no\n  duplicate paths are included. If there are multiple strings, they are\n  autowrapped as an array. The order of the array elements is\n  undefined.\n\nWithin the search_str search string argument, the % and _ characters\nwork as for the LIKE operator: % matches any number of characters\n(including zero characters), and _ matches exactly one character.\n\nTo specify a literal % or _ character in the search string, precede it\nby the escape character. The default is \\ if the escape_char argument\nis missing or NULL. Otherwise, escape_char must be a constant that is\nempty or one character.\n\nFor more information about matching and escape character behavior, see\nthe description of LIKE in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-comparison-functions.html\n. For escape character handling, a difference from the LIKE behavior is\nthat the escape character for JSON_SEARCH() must evaluate to a constant\nat compile time, not just at execution time. For example, if\nJSON_SEARCH() is used in a prepared statement and the escape_char\nargument is supplied using a ? parameter, the parameter value might be\nconstant at execution time, but is not at compile time.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json-search-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SET @j = \'[\"abc\", [{\"k\": \"10\"}, \"def\"], {\"x\":\"abc\"}, {\"y\":\"bcd\"}]\';\n\nmysql>

In the following example, the\nsequence of values produced by RAND(3) is the same both places it\noccurs.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mathematical-functions.html\n\n','mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i INT);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.42 sec)\n\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(1),(2),(3);\nQuery OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)\nRecords: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n\nmysql> SELECT i, RAND() FROM t;\n+------+------------------+\n| i    | RAND()           |\n+------+------------------+\n|    1 | 0.61914388706828 |\n|    2 | 0.93845168309142 |\n|    3 | 0.83482678498591 |\n+------+------------------+\n3 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT i, RAND(3) FROM t;\n+------+------------------+\n| i    | RAND(3)          |\n+------+------------------+\n|    1 | 0.90576975597606 |\n|    2 | 0.37307905813035 |\n|    3 | 0.14808605345719 |\n+------+------------------+\n3 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT i, RAND() FROM t;\n+------+------------------+\n| i    | RAND()           |\n+------+------------------+\n|    1 | 0.35877890638893 |\n|    2 | 0.28941420772058 |\n|    3 | 0.37073435016976 |\n+------+------------------+\n3 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT i, RAND(3) FROM t;\n+------+------------------+\n| i    | RAND(3)          |\n+------+------------------+\n|    1 | 0.90576975597606 |\n|    2 | 0.37307905813035 |\n|    3 | 0.14808605345719 |\n+------+------------------+\n3 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mathematical-functions.html'),(99,'RPAD',38,'Syntax:\nRPAD(str,len,padstr)\n\nReturns the string str, right-padded with the string padstr to a length\nof len characters.

The precise syntax and\nsemantics depend on the storage engine used. In standard MySQL 5.7\nreleases, this is always an InnoDB tablespace. MySQL NDB Cluster 7.5\nalso supports tablespaces using the NDB storage engine in addition to\nthose using InnoDB.\n\nConsiderations for InnoDB\n\nAn InnoDB tablespace created using CREATE TABLESPACE is referred to as\na general tablespace. This is a shared tablespace, similar to the\nsystem tablespace. It can hold multiple tables, and supports all table\nrow formats. General tablespaces can be created in a location relative\nto or independent of the MySQL data directory.\n\nAfter creating an InnoDB general tablespace, you can use CREATE TABLE\ntbl_name ... TABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name or ALTER TABLE tbl_name\nTABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name to add tables to the tablespace.\n\nFor more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/general-tablespaces.html.\n\nConsiderations for NDB Cluster\n\nThis statement is used to create a tablespace, which can contain one or\nmore data files, providing storage space for MySQL Cluster Disk Data\ntables (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data.html).\nOne data file is created and added to the tablespace using this\nstatement. Additional data files may be added to the tablespace by\nusing the ALTER TABLESPACE statement (see [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE]).\n\n*Note*:\n\nAll MySQL Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This\nmeans that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely\neach Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a\ntablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a tablespace and\na data file with the same name.\n\nA log file group of one or more UNDO log files must be assigned to the\ntablespace to be created with the USE LOGFILE GROUP clause.\nlogfile_group must be an existing log file group created with CREATE\nLOGFILE GROUP (see [HELP CREATE LOGFILE GROUP]). Multiple tablespaces\nmay use the same log file group for UNDO logging.\n\nWhen setting EXTENT_SIZE or INITIAL_SIZE, you may optionally follow the\nnumber with a one-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude,\nsimilar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters\nM (for megabytes) or G (for gigabytes).\n\nINITIAL_SIZE and EXTENT_SIZE are subject to rounding as follows:\n\no EXTENT_SIZE is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of 32K.\n\no INITIAL_SIZE is rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of 32K;\n  this result is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of\n  EXTENT_SIZE (after any rounding).\n\nThe rounding just described is done explicitly, and a warning is issued\nby the MySQL Server when any such rounding is performed. The rounded\nvalues are also used by the NDB kernel for calculating\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES column values and other purposes. However, to\navoid an unexpected result, we suggest that you always use whole\nmultiples of 32K in specifying these options.\n\nWhen CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE [=] NDB, a tablespace and\nassociated data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can\nverify that the data files were created and obtain information about\nthem by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. (See the example\nlater in this section.)\n\n(See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/files-table.html.)\n\nOptions\n\no ADD DATAFILE: Defines the name of a tablespace data file; this option\n  is always required. An InnoDB tablespace supports only a single data\n  file, whose name must include a .ibd extension. A MySQL Cluster\n  tablespace supports multiple data files which can have any legal file\n  names; more data files can be added to a MySQL Cluster tablespace\n  following its creation by using an ALTER TABLESPACE statement.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  ALTER TABLESPACE is not supported by InnoDB.\n\n  To place the data file in a location outside of the MySQL data\n  directory (datadir), include an absolute directory path or a path\n  relative to the MySQL data directory. If you do not specify a path,\n  the tablespace is created in the MySQL data directory. An isl file is\n  created in the MySQL data directory when an InnoDB tablespace is\n  created outside of the MySQL data directory.\n\n  To avoid conflicts with implicitly created file-per-table\n  tablespaces, creating a general tablespace in a subdirectory under\n  the MySQL data directory is not supported. Also, when creating a\n  general tablespace outside of the MySQL data directory, the directory\n  must exist prior to creating the tablespace.\n\n  The file_name, including the path (optional), must be quoted with\n  single or double quotations marks. File names (not counting any\n  \".ibd\" extension for InnoDB files) and directory names must be at\n  least one byte in length. Zero length file names and directory names\n  are not supported.\n\no FILE_BLOCK_SIZE: This option---which is specific to InnoDB, and is\n  ignored by NDB---defines the block size for the tablespace data file.\n  If you do not specify this option, FILE_BLOCK_SIZE defaults to\n  innodb_page_size. FILE_BLOCK_SIZE is required when you intend to use\n  the tablespace for storing compressed InnoDB tables\n  (ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED).\n\n  If FILE_BLOCK_SIZE is equal innodb_page_size, the tablespace can\n  contain only tables having an uncompressed row format (COMPACT,\n  REDUNDANT, or DYNAMIC). The physical page size for tables using\n  COMPRESSED differs from that of uncompressed tables; this means that\n  compressed tables and uncompressed tables cannot coexist in the same\n  tablespace.\n\n  For a general tablespace to contain compressed tables,\n  FILE_BLOCK_SIZE must be specified, and the FILE_BLOCK_SIZE value must\n  be a valid compressed page size in relation to the innodb_page_size\n  value. Also, the physical page size of the compressed table\n  (KEY_BLOCK_SIZE) must be equal to FILE_BLOCK_SIZE/1024. For example,\n  if innodb_page_size=16K, and FILE_BLOCK_SIZE=8K, the KEY_BLOCK_SIZE\n  of the table must be 8. For more information, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/general-tablespaces.html.\n\no USE LOGFILE GROUP: Required for NDB, this is the name of a log file\n  group previously created using CREATE LOGFILE GROUP. Not supported\n  for InnoDB, where it fails with an error.\n\no EXTENT_SIZE: This option is specific to NDB, and is not supported by\n  InnoDB, where it fails with an error. EXTENT_SIZE sets the size, in\n  bytes, of the extents used by any files belonging to the tablespace.\n  The default value is 1M. The minimum size is 32K, and theoretical\n  maximum is 2G, although the practical maximum size depends on a\n  number of factors. In most cases, changing the extent size does not\n  have any measurable effect on performance, and the default value is\n  recommended for all but the most unusual situations.\n\n  An extent is a unit of disk space allocation. One extent is filled\n  with as much data as that extent can contain before another extent is\n  used. In theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file;\n  however, the recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The recommended\n  maximum size for a single data file is 32G---that is, 32K extents x 1\n  MB per extent. In addition, once an extent is allocated to a given\n  partition, it cannot be used to store data from a different\n  partition; an extent cannot store data from more than one partition.\n  This means, for example that a tablespace having a single datafile\n  whose INITIAL_SIZE (described in the following item) is 256 MB and\n  whose EXTENT_SIZE is 128M has just two extents, and so can be used to\n  store data from at most two different disk data table partitions.\n\n  You can see how many extents remain free in a given data file by\n  querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table, and so derive an\n  estimate for how much space remains free in the file. For further\n  discussion and examples, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/files-table.html.\n\no INITIAL_SIZE: This option is specific to NDB, and is not supported by\n  InnoDB, where it fails with an error.\n\n  The INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the total size in bytes of the data\n  file that was specific using ADD DATATFILE. Once this file has been\n  created, its size cannot be changed; however, you can add more data\n  files to the tablespace using ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE.\n\n  INITIAL_SIZE is optional; its default value is 134217728 (128 MB).\n\n  On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is\n  4294967296 (4 GB).\n\no AUTOEXTEND_SIZE: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible\n  future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL 5.7 or MySQL NDB\n  Cluster 7.5, regardless of the storage engine used.\n\no MAX_SIZE: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future\n  use.

Has no effect in any release of MySQL 5.7 or MySQL NDB Cluster\n  7.5, regardless of the storage engine used.\n\no ENGINE: Defines the storage engine which uses the tablespace, where\n  engine_name is the name of the storage engine. Currently, only the\n  InnoDB storage engine is supported by standard MySQL 5.7 releases.\n  MySQL NDB Cluster 7.5 supports both NDB and InnoDB tablespaces. The\n  value of the default_storage_engine system variable is used for\n  ENGINE if the option is not specified.\n\nNotes\n\no For the rules covering the naming of MySQL tablespaces, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifiers.html. In addition\n  to these rules, the slash character (\"/\") is not permitted, nor can\n  you use names beginning with innodb_, as this prefix is reserved for\n  system use.\n\no Tablespaces do not support temporary tables.\n\no The TABLESPACE option may be used with CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE to\n  assign InnoDB table partitions or subpartitions to a general\n  tablespace, a separate file-per-table tablespace, or the system\n  tablespace. TABLESPACE option support for table partitions and\n  subpartitions was added in MySQL 5.7. All partitions must belong to\n  the same storage engine. For more information, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/general-tablespaces.html.\n\no innodb_file_per_table, innodb_file_format, and innodb_file_format_max\n  settings have no influence on CREATE TABLESPACE operations.\n  innodb_file_per_table does not need to be enabled. General\n  tablespaces support all table row formats regardless of file format\n  settings. Likewise, general tablespaces support the addition of\n  tables of any row format using CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE,\n  regardless of file format settings.\n\no innodb_strict_mode is not applicable to general tablespaces.\n  Tablespace management rules are strictly enforced independently of\n  innodb_strict_mode. If CREATE TABLESPACE parameters are incorrect or\n  incompatible, the operation fails regardless of the\n  innodb_strict_mode setting. When a table is added to a general\n  tablespace using CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLE ...\n  TABLESPACE, innodb_strict_mode is ignored but the statement is\n  evaluated as if innodb_strict_mode is enabled.\n\no Use DROP TABLESPACE to remove a tablespace. All tables must be\n  dropped from a tablespace using DROP TABLE prior to dropping the\n  tablespace. Before dropping a MySQL Cluster tablespace you must also\n  remove all its data files using one or more ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP\n  DATATFILE statements. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-object\n  s.html.\n\no All parts of an InnoDB table added to an InnoDB general tablespace\n  reside in the general tablespace, including indexes and BLOB pages.\n\n  For an NDB table assigned to a tablespace, only those columns which\n  are not indexed are stored on disk, and actually use the tablespace\n  data files. Indexes and indexed columns for all NDB tables are always\n  kept in memory.\n\no Similar to the system tablespace, truncating or dropping tables\n  stored in a general tablespace creates free space internally in the\n  general tablespace .ibd data file which can only be used for new\n  InnoDB data. Space is not released back to the operating system as it\n  is for file-per-table tablespaces.\n\no A general tablespace is not associated with any database or schema.\n\no ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD TABLESPACE and ALTER TABLE ...IMPORT\n  TABLESPACE are not supported for tables that belong to a general\n  tablespace.\n\no The server uses tablespace-level metadata locking for DDL that\n  references general tablespaces. By comparison, the server uses\n  table-level metadata locking for DDL that references file-per-table\n  tablespaces.\n\no A generated or existing tablespace cannot be changed to a general\n  tablespace.\n\no Tables stored in a general tablespace can only be opened in MySQL\n  5.7.6 or later due to the addition of new table flags.\n\no There is no conflict between general tablespace names and\n  file-per-table tablespace names. The \"/\" character, which is present\n  in file-per-table tablespace names, is not permitted in general\n  tablespace names.\n\nInnoDB Examples\n\nThis example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding\nthree uncompressed tables of different row formats.\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1`\n    ->     ADD DATAFILE \'ts1.ibd\'\n    ->     ENGINE=INNODB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY)\n    ->     TABLESPACE ts1\n    ->     ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY)\n    ->     TABLESPACE ts1\n    ->     ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY)\n    ->     TABLESPACE ts1\n    ->     ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nThis example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding a\ncompressed table. The example assumes a default innodb_page_size of\n16K. The FILE_BLOCK_SIZE of 8192 requires that the compressed table\nhave a KEY_BLOCK_SIZE of 8.\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts2`\n    ->   ADD DATAFILE \'ts2.ibd\'\n    ->   FILE_BLOCK_SIZE = 8192\n    ->   ENGINE=INNODB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t4 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY)\n    ->   TABLESPACE ts2\n    ->   ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED\n    ->   KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nNDB Example\n\nSuppose that you wish to create a MySQL Cluster Disk Data tablespace\nnamed myts using a datafile named mydata-1.dat. An NDB tablespace\nalways requires the use of a log file group consisting of one or more\nundo log files. For this example, we first create a log file group\nnamed mylg that contains one undo long file named myundo-1.dat, using\nthe CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement shown here:\n\nmysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP myg1\n    ->     ADD UNDOFILE \'myundo-1.dat\'\n    ->     ENGINE=NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (3.29 sec)\n\nNow you can create the tablespace previously described using the\nfollowing statement:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLESPACE myts\n    ->     ADD DATAFILE \'mydata-1.dat\'\n    ->     USE LOGFILE GROUP mylg\n    ->     ENGINE=NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (2.98 sec)\n\nYou can now create a Disk Data table using a CREATE TABLE statement\nwith the TABLESPACE and STORAGE DISK options, similar to what is shown\nhere:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (\n    ->     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    ->     lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    ->     fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    ->     dob DATE NOT NULL,\n    ->     joined DATE NOT NULL,\n    ->     INDEX(last_name, first_name)\n    -> )\n    ->     TABLESPACE myts STORAGE DISK\n    ->     ENGINE=NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (1.41 sec)\n\nIt is important to note that only the dob and joined columns from\nmytable are actually stored on disk, due to the fact that the id,\nlname, and fname columns are all indexed.\n\nAs mentioned previously, when CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE [=]\nNDB, a tablespace and associated data file are created on each MySQL\nCluster data node. You can verify that the data files were created and\nobtain information about them by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\ntable, as shown here:\n\nmysql> SELECT FILE_NAME, FILE_TYPE, LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, STATUS, EXTRA\n    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\n    ->     WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = \'myts\';\n\n+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+\n| file_name    | file_type  | logfile_group_name | status | extra          |\n+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+\n| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=5 |\n| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=6 |\n| NULL         | TABLESPACE | mylg               | NORMAL | NULL           |\n+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+\n3 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n\nFor additional information and examples, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.\nhtml.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-tablespace.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-tablespace.html'),(122,'ST_GEOMFROMTEXT',4,'ST_GeomFromText(wkt[, srid]), ST_GeometryFromText(wkt[, srid])\n\nConstructs a geometry value of any type using its WKT representation\nand SRID.\n\nThe result is NULL if the geometry argument is NULL or not a\nsyntactically well-formed geometry, or if the SRID argument is NULL.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/gis-wkt-functions.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/gis-wkt-functions.html'),(123,'INSERT FUNCTION',38,'Syntax:\nINSERT(str,pos,len,newstr)\n\nReturns the string str, with the substring beginning at position pos\nand len characters long replaced by the string newstr.

When the read_only system\nvariable is enabled, GRANT additionally requires the SUPER privilege.\n\nThe REVOKE statement is related to GRANT and enables administrators to\nremove account privileges. See [HELP REVOKE].\n\nEach account name uses the format described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/account-names.html. For example:\n\nGRANT ALL ON db1.* TO \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\';\n\nThe host name part of the account, if omitted, defaults to \'%\'.\n\nNormally, a database administrator first uses CREATE USER to create an\naccount and define its nonprivilege characteristics such as its\npassword, whether it uses secure connections, and limits on access to\nserver resources, then uses GRANT to define its privileges. ALTER USER\nmay be used to change the nonprivilege characteristics of existing\naccounts. For example:\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED BY \'mypass\';\nGRANT ALL ON db1.* TO \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\';\nGRANT SELECT ON db2.invoice TO \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\';\nALTER USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 90;\n\n*Note*:\n\nExamples shown here include no IDENTIFIED clause. It is assumed that\nyou establish passwords with CREATE USER at account-creation time to\navoid creating insecure accounts.\n\n*Note*:\n\nIf an account named in a GRANT statement does not already exist, GRANT\nmay create it under the conditions described later in the discussion of\nthe NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER SQL mode. It is also possible to use GRANT to\nspecify nonprivilege account characteristics such as whether it uses\nsecure connections and limits on access to server resources.\n\nHowever, use of GRANT to create accounts or define nonprivilege\ncharacteristics is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.6. Instead, perform these\ntasks using CREATE USER or ALTER USER.\n\nFrom the mysql program, GRANT responds with Query OK, 0 rows affected\nwhen executed successfully.

(In a stored routine,\nvariables with character data types use the database defaults if the\ncharacter set or collation are not specified explicitly. See [HELP\nCREATE PROCEDURE].)\n\nUpgrading from Versions Older than MySQL 5.1\n\nThe syntax that includes the UPGRADE DATA DIRECTORY NAME clause updates\nthe name of the directory associated with the database to use the\nencoding implemented in MySQL 5.1 for mapping database names to\ndatabase directory names (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifier-mapping.html). This\nclause is for use under these conditions:\n\no It is intended when upgrading MySQL to 5.1 or later from older\n  versions.\n\no It is intended to update a database directory name to the current\n  encoding format if the name contains special characters that need\n  encoding.\n\no The statement is used by mysqlcheck (as invoked by mysql_upgrade).\n\nFor example, if a database in MySQL 5.0 has the name a-b-c, the name\ncontains instances of the - (dash) character. In MySQL 5.0, the\ndatabase directory is also named a-b-c, which is not necessarily safe\nfor all file systems. In MySQL 5.1 and later, the same database name is\nencoded as a@002db@002dc to produce a file system-neutral directory\nname.\n\nWhen a MySQL installation is upgraded to MySQL 5.1 or later from an\nolder version,the server displays a name such as a-b-c (which is in the\nold format) as #mysql50#a-b-c, and you must refer to the name using the\n#mysql50# prefix.

These statements also display\ninformation for views. The description for SHOW COLUMNS provides more\ninformation about the output columns. See [HELP SHOW COLUMNS].\n\nBy default, DESCRIBE displays information about all columns in the\ntable. col_name, if given, is the name of a column in the table. In\nthis case, the statement displays information only for the named\ncolumn. wild, if given, is a pattern string. It can contain the SQL %\nand _ wildcard characters. In this case, the statement displays output\nonly for the columns with names matching the string. There is no need\nto enclose the string within quotation marks unless it contains spaces\nor other special characters.\n\nThe DESCRIBE statement is provided for compatibility with Oracle.\n\nThe SHOW CREATE TABLE, SHOW TABLE STATUS, and SHOW INDEX statements\nalso provide information about tables. See [HELP SHOW].\n\nObtaining Execution Plan Information\n\nThe EXPLAIN statement provides information about how MySQL executes\nstatements:\n\no EXPLAIN works with SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE, and UPDATE\n  statements.\n\no When EXPLAIN is used with an explainable statement, MySQL displays\n  information from the optimizer about the statement execution plan.\n  That is, MySQL explains how it would process the statement, including\n  information about how tables are joined and in which order. For\n  information about using EXPLAIN to obtain execution plan information,\n  see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html.\n\no When EXPLAIN is used with FOR CONNECTION connection_id rather than an\n  explainable statement, it displays the execution plan for the\n  statement executing in the named connection. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-for-connection.html.\n\no For SELECT statements, EXPLAIN produces additional execution plan\n  information. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-extended.html.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  In older MySQL releases, extended information was produced using\n  EXPLAIN EXTENDED. That syntax is still recognized for backward\n  compatibility but extended output is now enabled by default, so the\n  EXTENDED keyword is superfluous and deprecated. Its use results in a\n  warning, and it will be removed from EXPLAIN syntax in a future MySQL\n  release.\n\no EXPLAIN is useful for examining queries involving partitioned tables.\n  See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-info.html.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  In older MySQL releases, partition information was produced using\n  EXPLAIN PARTITIONS. That syntax is still recognized for backward\n  compatibility but partition output is now enabled by default, so the\n  PARTITIONS keyword is superfluous and deprecated. Its use results in\n  a warning, and it will be removed from EXPLAIN syntax in a future\n  MySQL release.\n\no The FORMAT option can be used to select the output format.\n  TRADITIONAL presents the output in tabular format. This is the\n  default if no FORMAT option is present. JSON format displays the\n  information in JSON format.\n\nWith the help of EXPLAIN, you can see where you should add indexes to\ntables so that the statement executes faster by using indexes to find\nrows. You can also use EXPLAIN to check whether the optimizer joins the\ntables in an optimal order. To give a hint to the optimizer to use a\njoin order corresponding to the order in which the tables are named in\na SELECT statement, begin the statement with SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN\nrather than just SELECT. (See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html.)\n\nThe optimizer trace may sometimes provide information complementary to\nthat of EXPLAIN. However, the optimizer trace format and content are\nsubject to change between versions. For details, see MySQL Internals:\nTracing the Optimizer\n(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/optimizer-tracing.html).\n\nIf you have a problem with indexes not being used when you believe that\nthey should be, run ANALYZE TABLE to update table statistics, such as\ncardinality of keys, that can affect the choices the optimizer makes.\nSee [HELP ANALYZE TABLE].\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html'),(162,'DEGREES',3,'Syntax:\nDEGREES(X)\n\nReturns the argument X, converted from radians to degrees.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mathematical-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SELECT DEGREES(PI());\n        -> 180\nmysql> SELECT DEGREES(PI() / 2);\n        -> 90\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mathematical-functions.html'),(163,'- UNARY',3,'Syntax:\n-\n\nUnary minus.

This may be useful if\n  you simply do not care which value of a nonaggregated column is\n  chosen for each group.

This means that timestamp settings in the\nbinary log have no effect on invocations of SYSDATE().\n\nBecause SYSDATE() can return different values even within the same\nstatement, and is not affected by SET TIMESTAMP, it is nondeterministic\nand therefore unsafe for replication if statement-based binary logging\nis used.

By default, a routine is\nassociated with the default database. To associate the routine\nexplicitly with a given database, specify the name as db_name.sp_name\nwhen you create it.\n\nThe CREATE FUNCTION statement is also used in MySQL to support UDFs\n(user-defined functions). See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/adding-functions.html. A UDF can\nbe regarded as an external stored function. Stored functions share\ntheir namespace with UDFs. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/function-resolution.html, for\nthe rules describing how the server interprets references to different\nkinds of functions.\n\nTo invoke a stored procedure, use the CALL statement (see [HELP CALL]).\nTo invoke a stored function, refer to it in an expression. The function\nreturns a value during expression evaluation.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION require the CREATE ROUTINE\nprivilege. They might also require the SUPER privilege, depending on\nthe DEFINER value, as described later in this section. If binary\nlogging is enabled, CREATE FUNCTION might require the SUPER privilege,\nas described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-programs-logging.html.\n\nBy default, MySQL automatically grants the ALTER ROUTINE and EXECUTE\nprivileges to the routine creator. This behavior can be changed by\ndisabling the automatic_sp_privileges system variable. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-routines-privileges.html.\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be\nused when checking access privileges at routine execution time, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nIf the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL function,\na syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the name and the\nfollowing parenthesis when defining the routine or invoking it later.\nFor this reason, avoid using the names of existing SQL functions for\nyour own stored routines.\n\nThe IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to stored\nroutines. It is always permissible to have spaces after a stored\nroutine name, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.\n\nThe parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.\nIf there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of () should be\nused. Parameter names are not case sensitive.\n\nEach parameter is an IN parameter by default. To specify otherwise for\na parameter, use the keyword OUT or INOUT before the parameter name.\n\n*Note*:\n\nSpecifying a parameter as IN, OUT, or INOUT is valid only for a\nPROCEDURE. For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN\nparameters.\n\nAn IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might\nmodify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller\nwhen the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the\nprocedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the\nprocedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure\nreturns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be\nmodified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is\nvisible to the caller when the procedure returns.\n\nFor each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the\nCALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its\nvalue when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from\nwithin another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a\nroutine parameter or local routine variable as an IN or INOUT\nparameter.\n\nRoutine parameters cannot be referenced in statements prepared within\nthe routine; see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-program-restrictions.html\n.\n\nThe following example shows a simple stored procedure that uses an OUT\nparameter:\n\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE PROCEDURE simpleproc (OUT param1 INT)\n    -> BEGIN\n    ->   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO param1 FROM t;\n    -> END//\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> delimiter ;\n\nmysql> CALL simpleproc(@a);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @a;\n+------+\n| @a   |\n+------+\n| 3    |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe example uses the mysql client delimiter command to change the\nstatement delimiter from ; to // while the procedure is being defined.\nThis enables the ; delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed\nthrough to the server rather than being interpreted by mysql itself.\nSee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-programs-defining.html.\n\nThe RETURNS clause may be specified only for a FUNCTION, for which it\nis mandatory. It indicates the return type of the function, and the\nfunction body must contain a RETURN value statement. If the RETURN\nstatement returns a value of a different type, the value is coerced to\nthe proper type. For example, if a function specifies an ENUM or SET\nvalue in the RETURNS clause, but the RETURN statement returns an\ninteger, the value returned from the function is the string for the\ncorresponding ENUM member of set of SET members.\n\nThe following example function takes a parameter, performs an operation\nusing an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is\nunnecessary to use delimiter because the function definition contains\nno internal ; statement delimiters:\n\nmysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))\nmysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC\n    -> RETURN CONCAT(\'Hello, \',s,\'!\');\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT hello(\'world\');\n+----------------+\n| hello(\'world\') |\n+----------------+\n| Hello, world!  |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nParameter types and function return types can be declared to use any\nvalid data type. The COLLATE attribute can be used if preceded by the\nCHARACTER SET attribute.\n\nThe routine_body consists of a valid SQL routine statement. This can be\na simple statement such as SELECT or INSERT, or a compound statement\nwritten using BEGIN and END. Compound statements can contain\ndeclarations, loops, and other control structure statements. The syntax\nfor these statements is described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-syntax-compound-statements.h\ntml.\n\nMySQL permits routines to contain DDL statements, such as CREATE and\nDROP. MySQL also permits stored procedures (but not stored functions)\nto contain SQL transaction statements such as COMMIT. Stored functions\nmay not contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or\nrollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL\nstandard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to\npermit them.\n\nStatements that return a result set can be used within a stored\nprocedure but not within a stored function. This prohibition includes\nSELECT statements that do not have an INTO var_list clause and other\nstatements such as SHOW, EXPLAIN, and CHECK TABLE. For statements that\ncan be determined at function definition time to return a result set, a\nNot allowed to return a result set from a function error occurs\n(ER_SP_NO_RETSET). For statements that can be determined only at\nruntime to return a result set, a PROCEDURE %s can\'t return a result\nset in the given context error occurs (ER_SP_BADSELECT).\n\nUSE statements within stored routines are not permitted. When a routine\nis invoked, an implicit USE db_name is performed (and undone when the\nroutine terminates). The causes the routine to have the given default\ndatabase while it executes. References to objects in databases other\nthan the routine default database should be qualified with the\nappropriate database name.\n\nFor additional information about statements that are not permitted in\nstored routines, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-program-restrictions.html\n.\n\nFor information about invoking stored procedures from within programs\nwritten in a language that has a MySQL interface, see [HELP CALL].\n\nMySQL stores the sql_mode system variable setting in effect when a\nroutine is created or altered, and always executes the routine with\nthis setting in force, regardless of the current server SQL mode when\nthe routine begins executing.\n\nThe switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine\noccurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the resulting\nvalues to routine parameters. If you define a routine in strict SQL\nmode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of arguments to\nroutine parameters does not take place in strict mode. If you require\nthat expressions passed to a routine be assigned in strict SQL mode,\nyou should invoke the routine with strict mode in effect.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-procedure.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-procedure.html'),(197,'GET DIAGNOSTICS',24,'Syntax:\nGET [CURRENT | STACKED] DIAGNOSTICS\n{\n    statement_information_item\n    [, statement_information_item] ...\n  | CONDITION condition_number\n    condition_information_item\n    [, condition_information_item] ...\n}\n\nstatement_information_item:\n    target = statement_information_item_name\n\ncondition_information_item:\n    target = condition_information_item_name\n\nstatement_information_item_name:\n    NUMBER\n  | ROW_COUNT\n\ncondition_information_item_name:\n    CLASS_ORIGIN\n  | SUBCLASS_ORIGIN\n  | RETURNED_SQLSTATE\n  | MESSAGE_TEXT\n  | MYSQL_ERRNO\n  | CONSTRAINT_CATALOG\n  | CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA\n  | CONSTRAINT_NAME\n  | CATALOG_NAME\n  | SCHEMA_NAME\n  | TABLE_NAME\n  | COLUMN_NAME\n  | CURSOR_NAME\n\ncondition_number, target:\n    (see following discussion)\n\nSQL statements produce diagnostic information that populates the\ndiagnostics area.

The keyword STACKED means to retrieve information\nfrom the second diagnostics area, which is available only if the\ncurrent context is a condition handler. If neither keyword is given,\nthe default is to use the current diagnostics area.\n\nThe GET DIAGNOSTICS statement is typically used in a handler within a\nstored program. It is a MySQL extension that GET [CURRENT] DIAGNOSTICS\nis permitted outside handler context to check the execution of any SQL\nstatement. For example, if you invoke the mysql client program, you can\nenter these statements at the prompt:\n\nmysql> DROP TABLE test.no_such_table;\nERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table \'test.no_such_table\'\nmysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n    ->   @p1 = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, @p2 = MESSAGE_TEXT;\nmysql> SELECT @p1, @p2;\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n| @p1   | @p2                                |\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n| 42S02 | Unknown table \'test.no_such_table\' |\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n\nThis extension applies only to the current diagnostics area. It does\nnot apply to the second diagnostics area because GET STACKED\nDIAGNOSTICS is permitted only if the current context is a condition\nhandler. If that is not the case, a GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS when\nhandler not active error occurs.\n\nFor a description of the diagnostics area, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/diagnostics-area.html. Briefly,\nit contains two kinds of information:\n\no Statement information, such as the number of conditions that occurred\n  or the affected-rows count.\n\no Condition information, such as the error code and message. If a\n  statement raises multiple conditions, this part of the diagnostics\n  area has a condition area for each one. If a statement raises no\n  conditions, this part of the diagnostics area is empty.\n\nFor a statement that produces three conditions, the diagnostics area\ncontains statement and condition information like this:\n\nStatement information:\n  row count\n  ... other statement information items ...\nCondition area list:\n  Condition area 1:\n    error code for condition 1\n    error message for condition 1\n    ... other condition information items ...\n  Condition area 2:\n    error code for condition 2:\n    error message for condition 2\n    ... other condition information items ...\n  Condition area 3:\n    error code for condition 3\n    error message for condition 3\n    ... other condition information items ...\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS can obtain either statement or condition information,\nbut not both in the same statement:\n\no To obtain statement information, retrieve the desired statement items\n  into target variables. This instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the\n  number of available conditions and the rows-affected count to the\n  user variables @p1 and @p2:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS @p1 = NUMBER, @p2 = ROW_COUNT;\n\no To obtain condition information, specify the condition number and\n  retrieve the desired condition items into target variables. This\n  instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the SQLSTATE value and error\n  message to the user variables @p3 and @p4:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n  @p3 = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, @p4 = MESSAGE_TEXT;\n\nThe retrieval list specifies one or more target = item_name\nassignments, separated by commas. Each assignment names a target\nvariable and either a statement_information_item_name or\ncondition_information_item_name designator, depending on whether the\nstatement retrieves statement or condition information.\n\nValid target designators for storing item information can be stored\nprocedure or function parameters, stored program local variables\ndeclared with DECLARE, or user-defined variables.\n\nValid condition_number designators can be stored procedure or function\nparameters, stored program local variables declared with DECLARE,\nuser-defined variables, system variables, or literals. A character\nliteral may include a _charset introducer. A warning occurs if the\ncondition number is not in the range from 1 to the number of condition\nareas that have information. In this case, the warning is added to the\ndiagnostics area without clearing it.\n\nWhen a condition occurs, MySQL does not populate all condition items\nrecognized by GET DIAGNOSTICS. For example:\n\nmysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n    ->   @p5 = SCHEMA_NAME, @p6 = TABLE_NAME;\nmysql> SELECT @p5, @p6;\n+------+------+\n| @p5  | @p6  |\n+------+------+\n|      |      |\n+------+------+\n\nIn standard SQL, if there are multiple conditions, the first condition\nrelates to the SQLSTATE value returned for the previous SQL statement.\nIn MySQL, this is not guaranteed. To get the main error, you cannot do\nthis:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1 @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;\n\nInstead, retrieve the condition count first, then use it to specify\nwhich condition number to inspect:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS @cno = NUMBER;\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION @cno @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;\n\nFor information about permissible statement and condition information\nitems, and which ones are populated when a condition occurs, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/diagnostics-area.html#diagnostic\ns-area-information-items.\n\nHere is an example that uses GET DIAGNOSTICS and an exception handler\nin stored procedure context to assess the outcome of an insert\noperation.

QUICK returns the \"live\" table checksum that can be\nreturned very fast. If the table does not meet all these conditions,\nthe QUICK method returns NULL. See [HELP CREATE TABLE] for the syntax\nof the CHECKSUM clause.\n\nFor a nonexistent table, CHECKSUM TABLE returns NULL and generates a\nwarning.\n\nThe checksum value depends on the table row format. If the row format\nchanges, the checksum also changes. For example, the storage format for\ntemporal types such as TIME, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP changed in MySQL\n5.6 prior to MySQL 5.6.5, so if a 5.5 table is upgraded to MySQL 5.6,\nthe checksum value may change.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/checksum-table.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/checksum-table.html'),(250,'NUMINTERIORRINGS',2,'NumInteriorRings(poly)\n\nST_NumInteriorRings() and NumInteriorRings() are synonyms.

The host name part of\nthe account name, if omitted, defaults to \'%\'. For example, to set the\npassword for an account with User and Host column values of \'bob\' and\n\'%.example.org\', write the statement like this:\n\nSET PASSWORD FOR \'bob\'@\'%.example.org\' = PASSWORD(\'auth_string\');\n\nThe password can be specified in these ways:\n\no Using the PASSWORD() function (deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.6)\n\n  The \'auth_string\' function argument is the cleartext (unencrypted)\n  password.

This hashing method is appropriate only for\n  accounts that use the mysql_old_password authentication plugin.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  Passwords that use the pre-4.1 hashing method are less secure than\n  passwords that use the native password hashing method and should be\n  avoided. Pre-4.1 passwords are deprecated and support for them is\n  removed in MySQL 5.7.5. Consequently, OLD_PASSWORD() is deprecated\n  and is removed in MySQL 5.7.5.

Any missing columns are set to their default values,\njust as happens for INSERT. You cannot refer to values from the current\nrow and use them in the new row. If you use an assignment such as SET\ncol_name = col_name + 1, the reference to the column name on the right\nhand side is treated as DEFAULT(col_name), so the assignment is\nequivalent to SET col_name = DEFAULT(col_name) + 1.\n\nIf a generated column is replaced explicitly, the only permitted value\nis DEFAULT.

Unlike the case\nwith the server options, this statement does not require restarting the\nserver to take effect, only that the slave SQL thread be stopped using\nSTOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD first (and restarted with START SLAVE SQL_THREAD\nafterwards). CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER requires the SUPER privilege.\n\nThe following list shows the CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER options and how\nthey relate to --replicate-* server options:\n\no REPLICATE_DO_DB: Include updates based on database name. Equivalent\n  to --replicate-do-db.\n\no REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB: Exclude updates based on database name.\n  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-db.\n\no REPLICATE_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on table name. Equivalent\n  to --replicate-do-table.\n\no REPLICATE_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on table name.\n  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-table.\n\no REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on wildcard pattern\n  matching table name. Equivalent to --replicate-wild-do-table.\n\no REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on wildcard\n  pattern matching table name. Equivalent to\n  --replicate-wild-ignore-table.\n\no REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB: Perform updates on slave after substituting new\n  name on slave for specified database on master. Equivalent to\n  --replicate-rewrite-db.\n\nThe precise effects of REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB filters\nare dependent on whether statement-based or row-based replication is in\neffect. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-rules.html, for more\ninformation.\n\nMultiple replication filtering rules can be created in a single CHANGE\nREPLICATION FILTER statement by separating the rules with commas, as\nshown here:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (d1), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = (d2);\n\nIssuing the statement just shown is equivalent to starting the slave\nmysqld with the options --replicate-do-db=d1 --replicate-ignore-db=d2.\n\nIf the same filtering rule is specified multiple times, only the last\nsuch rule is actually used. For example, the two statements shown here\nhave exactly the same effect, because the first REPLICATE_DO_DB rule in\nthe first statement is ignored:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db1, db2), REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3, db4);\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3,db4);\n\n*Caution*:\n\nThis behavior differs from that of the --replicate-* filter options\nwhere specifying the same option multiple times causes the creation of\nmultiple filter rules.\n\nNames of tables and database not containing any special characters need\nnot be quoted. Values used with REPLICATION_WILD_TABLE and\nREPLICATION_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE are string expressions, possibly\ncontaining (special) wildcard characters, and so must be quoted. This\nis shown in the following example statements:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE = (\'db1.old%\');\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE = (\'db1.new%\', \'db2.new%\');\n\nValues used with REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB represent pairs of database\nnames; each such value must be enclosed in parentheses. The following\nstatement rewrites statements occurring on database dbA on the master\nto database dbB on the slave:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((db1, db2));\n\nThe statement just shown contains two sets of parentheses, one\nenclosing the pair of database names, and the other enclosing the\nentire list. This is perhap more easily seen in the following example,\nwhich creates two rewrite-db rules, one rewriting database dbA to dbB,\nand one rewriting database dbC to dbD:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n  REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((dbA, dbB), (dbC, dbD));\n\nThis statement leaves any existing replication filtering rules\nunchanged; to unset all filters of a given type, set the filter\'s value\nto an explicitly empty list, as shown in this example, which removes\nall existing REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB rules:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = ();\n\nSetting a filter to empty in this way removes all existing rules, does\nnot create any new ones, and does not restore any rules set at mysqld\nstartup using --replicate-* options on the command line or in the\nconfiguration file.\n\nValues employed with REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE and\nREPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE must be in the format db_name.tbl_name.\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.5, this was not strictly enforced, although using\nnonconforming values with these options could lead to erroneous results\n(Bug #18095449).\n\nFor more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-rules.html.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-replication-filter.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-replication-filter.html'),(329,'INTEGER',23,'INTEGER[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]\n\nThis type is a synonym for INT.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-type-overview.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-type-overview.html'),(330,'SHOW COLUMNS',27,'Syntax:\nSHOW [FULL] COLUMNS {FROM | IN} tbl_name [{FROM | IN} db_name]\n    [LIKE \'pattern\' | WHERE expr]\n\nSHOW COLUMNS displays information about the columns in a given table.\nIt also works for views.

This can be used to avoid deadlocks between STOP SLAVE and\nother slave SQL statements using different client connections to the\nslave. (Bug #16856735)\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.4, it was necessary to issue this statement on a\nrunning slave prior to executing CHANGE MASTER TO. In MySQL 5.7.4 and\nlater, this is no longer always the case; some CHANGE MASTER TO\nstatements are now allowed while the slave is running, depending on the\nstates of the slave SQL and I/O threads. However, using STOP SLAVE\nprior to executing CHANGE MASTER TO in such cases is still supported.\nSee [HELP CHANGE MASTER TO], and\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-solutions-switch.htm\nl, for more information.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause added in MySQL 5.7.6 enables\nyou to choose which replication channel the statement applies to. If no\nclause is set and no extra channels exist, the statement applies to the\ndefault channel and behaves the same as versions of MySQL prior to\n5.7.6. Providing a FOR CHANNEL channel clause applies the STOP SLAVE\nstatement to a specific replication channel. If a STOP SLAVE statement\ndoes not have a channel defined when using multiple channels, this\nstatement stops the specified threads for all channels. Beginning with\nMySQL 5.7.9, this statement cannot be used with the\ngroup_replication_recovery channel. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nWhen using statement-based replication: changing the master while it\nhas open temporary tables is potentially unsafe. This is one of the\nreasons why statement-based replication of temporary tables is not\nrecommended. You can find out whether there are any temporary tables on\nthe slave by checking the value of Slave_open_temp_tables; when using\nstatement-based replication, this value should be 0 before executing\nCHANGE MASTER TO. In MySQL 5.7.4 and later, if there are any temporary\ntables open on the slave, issuing a CHANGE MASTER TO statement after\nissuing a STOP SLAVE causes an ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO\nwarning.\n\nWhen using a multi-threaded slave (slave_parallel_workers is a nonzero\nvalue), any gaps in the sequence of transactions executed from the\nrelay log are closed as part of stopping the worker threads. If the\nslave is stopped unexpectedly (for example due to an error in a worker\nthread, or another thread issuing KILL) while a STOP SLAVE statement is\nexecuting, the sequence of executed transactions from the relay log may\nbecome inconsistent. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-features-transaction\n-inconsistencies.html, for more information.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7, STOP SLAVE waits until the current replication\ntransaction affecting one or more nontransactional tables has finished\nexecuting (if there is any such transaction), or until you issue a KILL\nQUERY or KILL CONNECTION statement.

AGAINST takes a string to search for, and an optional\nmodifier that indicates what type of search to perform. The search\nstring must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation.\nThis rules out, for example, a table column because that can differ for\neach row.\n\nThere are three types of full-text searches:\n\no A natural language search interprets the search string as a phrase in\n  natural human language (a phrase in free text). There are no special\n  operators. The stopword list applies. For more information about\n  stopword lists, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-stopwords.html.\n\n  Full-text searches are natural language searches if the IN NATURAL\n  LANGUAGE MODE modifier is given or if no modifier is given. For more\n  information, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-natural-language.html\n  .\n\no A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a\n  special query language. The string contains the words to search for.\n  It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a\n  word must be present or absent in matching rows, or that it should be\n  weighted higher or lower than usual. Certain common words (stopwords)\n  are omitted from the search index and do not match if present in the\n  search string. The IN BOOLEAN MODE modifier specifies a boolean\n  search. For more information, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-boolean.html.\n\no A query expansion search is a modification of a natural language\n  search. The search string is used to perform a natural language\n  search. Then words from the most relevant rows returned by the search\n  are added to the search string and the search is done again. The\n  query returns the rows from the second search. The IN NATURAL\n  LANGUAGE MODE WITH QUERY EXPANSION or WITH QUERY EXPANSION modifier\n  specifies a query expansion search.

Lock release may also occur with another call\nto GET_LOCK():\n\no Before 5.7.5, only a single simultaneous lock can be acquired and\n  GET_LOCK() releases any existing lock.\n\no In MySQL 5.7.5, GET_LOCK() was reimplemented using the metadata\n  locking (MDL) subsystem and its capabilities were extended. Multiple\n  simultaneous locks can be acquired and GET_LOCK() does not release\n  any existing locks. It is even possible for a given session to\n  acquire multiple locks for the same name. Other sessions cannot\n  acquire a lock with that name until the acquiring session releases\n  all its locks for the name.\n\n  As a result of the MDL reimplementation, locks acquired with\n  GET_LOCK() appear in the Performance Schema metadata_locks table. The\n  OBJECT_TYPE column says USER LEVEL LOCK and the OBJECT_NAME column\n  indicates the lock name. Also, the capability of acquiring multiple\n  locks introduces the possibility of deadlock among clients. When this\n  happens, the server chooses a caller and terminates its\n  lock-acquisition request with an ER_USER_LOCK_DEADLOCK error. This\n  error does not cause transactions to roll back.\n\nThe difference in lock acquisition behavior as of MySQL 5.7.5 can be\nseen by the following example. Suppose that you execute these\nstatements:\n\nSELECT GET_LOCK(\'lock1\',10);\nSELECT GET_LOCK(\'lock2\',10);\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK(\'lock2\');\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK(\'lock1\');\n\nIn MySQL 5.7.5 or later, the second GET_LOCK() acquires a second lock\nand both RELEASE_LOCK() calls return 1 (success). Before MySQL 5.7.5,\nthe second GET_LOCK() releases the first lock (\'lock1\') and the second\nRELEASE_LOCK() returns NULL (failure) because there is no \'lock1\' to\nrelease.\n\nMySQL 5.7.5 and later enforces a maximum length on lock names of 64\ncharacters. Previously, no limit was enforced.\n\nLocks obtained with GET_LOCK() are not released when transactions\ncommit or roll back.\n\nGET_LOCK() can be used to implement application locks or to simulate\nrecord locks. Names are locked on a server-wide basis. If a name has\nbeen locked within one session, GET_LOCK() blocks any request by\nanother session for a lock with the same name. This enables clients\nthat agree on a given lock name to use the name to perform cooperative\nadvisory locking. But be aware that it also enables a client that is\nnot among the set of cooperating clients to lock a name, either\ninadvertently or deliberately, and thus prevent any of the cooperating\nclients from locking that name. One way to reduce the likelihood of\nthis is to use lock names that are database-specific or\napplication-specific. For example, use lock names of the form\ndb_name.str or app_name.str.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/miscellaneous-functions.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/miscellaneous-functions.html'),(393,'BIGINT',23,'BIGINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]\n\nA large integer.

The only isolation level that permits a consistent read is\n  REPEATABLE READ. For all other isolation levels, the WITH CONSISTENT\n  SNAPSHOT clause is ignored.

The READ ONLY restriction prevents the transaction from\n  modifying or locking both transactional and nontransactional tables\n  that are visible to other transactions; the transaction can still\n  modify or lock temporary tables.\n\n  MySQL enables extra optimizations for queries on InnoDB tables when\n  the transaction is known to be read-only.

It is not permitted to\n  specify both READ WRITE and READ ONLY in the same statement.\n\n  In read-only mode, it remains possible to change tables created with\n  the TEMPORARY keyword using DML statements. Changes made with DDL\n  statements are not permitted, just as with permanent tables.\n\n  For additional information about transaction access mode, including\n  ways to change the default mode, see [HELP ISOLATION].\n\n  If the read_only system variable is enabled, explicitly starting a\n  transaction with START TRANSACTION READ WRITE requires the SUPER\n  privilege.\n\n*Important*:\n\nMany APIs used for writing MySQL client applications (such as JDBC)\nprovide their own methods for starting transactions that can (and\nsometimes should) be used instead of sending a START TRANSACTION\nstatement from the client. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/connectors-apis.html, or the\ndocumentation for your API, for more information.\n\nTo disable autocommit mode explicitly, use the following statement:\n\nSET autocommit=0;\n\nAfter disabling autocommit mode by setting the autocommit variable to\nzero, changes to transaction-safe tables (such as those for InnoDB or\nNDB) are not made permanent immediately. You must use COMMIT to store\nyour changes to disk or ROLLBACK to ignore the changes.\n\nautocommit is a session variable and must be set for each session. To\ndisable autocommit mode for each new connection, see the description of\nthe autocommit system variable at\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html.\n\nBEGIN and BEGIN WORK are supported as aliases of START TRANSACTION for\ninitiating a transaction. START TRANSACTION is standard SQL syntax, is\nthe recommended way to start an ad-hoc transaction, and permits\nmodifiers that BEGIN does not.\n\nThe BEGIN statement differs from the use of the BEGIN keyword that\nstarts a BEGIN ... END compound statement. The latter does not begin a\ntransaction. See [HELP BEGIN END].\n\n*Note*:\n\nWithin all stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers,\nand events), the parser treats BEGIN [WORK] as the beginning of a BEGIN\n... END block. Begin a transaction in this context with START\nTRANSACTION instead.\n\nThe optional WORK keyword is supported for COMMIT and ROLLBACK, as are\nthe CHAIN and RELEASE clauses. CHAIN and RELEASE can be used for\nadditional control over transaction completion. The value of the\ncompletion_type system variable determines the default completion\nbehavior. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html.\n\nThe AND CHAIN clause causes a new transaction to begin as soon as the\ncurrent one ends, and the new transaction has the same isolation level\nas the just-terminated transaction. The RELEASE clause causes the\nserver to disconnect the current client session after terminating the\ncurrent transaction. Including the NO keyword suppresses CHAIN or\nRELEASE completion, which can be useful if the completion_type system\nvariable is set to cause chaining or release completion by default.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/commit.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/commit.html'),(411,'TIME_FORMAT',32,'Syntax:\nTIME_FORMAT(time,format)\n\nThis is used like the DATE_FORMAT() function, but the format string may\ncontain format specifiers only for hours, minutes, seconds, and\nmicroseconds.

CHANGE MASTER\nTO requires the SUPER privilege.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.4, the slave replication threads must be stopped,\nusing STOP SLAVE if necessary, before issuing this statement. In MySQL\n5.7.4 and later, you can issue CHANGE MASTER TO statements on a running\nslave without doing this, depending on the states of the slave SQL\nthread and slave I/O thread. The rules governing such use are provided\nlater in this section.\n\nWhen using a multi-threaded slave (in other words\nslave_parallel_workers is greater than 0), stopping the slave can cause\n\"gaps\" in the sequence of transactions that have been executed from the\nrelay log, regardless of whether the slave was stopped intentionally or\notherwise. When such gaps exist, issuing CHANGE MASTER TO fails. The\nsolution in this situation is to issue START SLAVE UNTIL\nSQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS which ensures that the gaps are closed.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause added in MySQL 5.7.6 enables\nyou to choose which replication channel the statement applies to. If no\nclause is set and no extra channels exist, the statement applies to the\ndefault channel and behaves the same as versions of MySQL prior to\n5.7.6. Providing a FOR CHANNEL channel clause applies the CHANGE MASTER\nTO statement to a specific replication channel, and is used to add a\nnew channel or modify an existing channel. For example, to add a new\nchannel called channel2:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_NAME=host1, MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL channel2\n\nWhen using multiple replication channels, if a CHANGE MASTER TO\nstatement does not have a channel defined using a FOR CHANNEL channel\nclause an error is generated. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nOptions not specified retain their value, except as indicated in the\nfollowing discussion.

For example, if the password to connect to\nyour MySQL master has changed, issue this statement to tell the slave\nabout the new password:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD=\'new3cret\';\n\nMASTER_HOST, MASTER_USER, MASTER_PASSWORD, and MASTER_PORT provide\ninformation to the slave about how to connect to its master:\n\no MASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the host name (or IP address) of the\n  master host and its TCP/IP port.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  Replication cannot use Unix socket files. You must be able to connect\n  to the master MySQL server using TCP/IP.\n\n  If you specify the MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT option, the slave\n  assumes that the master server is different from before (even if the\n  option value is the same as its current value.) In this case, the old\n  values for the master binary log file name and position are\n  considered no longer applicable, so if you do not specify\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the statement,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'\' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are silently appended to it.\n\n  Setting MASTER_HOST=\'\' (that is, setting its value explicitly to an\n  empty string) is not the same as not setting MASTER_HOST at all.\n  Beginning with MySQL 5.5, trying to set MASTER_HOST to an empty\n  string fails with an error. Previously, setting MASTER_HOST to an\n  empty string caused START SLAVE subsequently to fail. (Bug #28796)\n\n  Values used for MASTER_HOST and other CHANGE MASTER TO options are\n  checked for linefeed (\\n or 0x0A) characters; the presence of such\n  characters in these values causes the statement to fail with\n  ER_MASTER_INFO. (Bug #11758581, Bug #50801)\n\no MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD are the user name and password of the\n  account to use for connecting to the master.\n\n  MASTER_USER cannot be made empty; setting MASTER_USER = \'\' or leaving\n  it unset when setting a value for MASTER_PASSWORD causes an error\n  (Bug #13427949).\n\n  The password used for a MySQL Replication slave account in a CHANGE\n  MASTER TO statement is limited to 32 characters in length; prior to\n  MySQL 5.7.5, if the password was longer, the statement succeeded, but\n  any excess characters were silently truncated. In MySQL 5.7.5 and\n  later, trying to use a password of more than 32 characters causes\n  CHANGE MASTER TO to fail. (Bug #11752299, Bug #43439)\n\n  The text of a running CHANGE MASTER TO statement, including values\n  for MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD, can be seen in the output of a\n  concurrent SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. (The complete text of a START\n  SLAVE statement is also visible to SHOW PROCESSLIST.)\n\nThe MASTER_SSL_xxx options provide information about using SSL for the\nconnection. They correspond to the --ssl-xxx options described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/secure-connection-options.html,\nand\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-solutions-secure-con\nnections.html. These options can be changed even on slaves that are\ncompiled without SSL support. They are saved to the master info\nrepository, but are ignored if the slave does not have SSL support\nenabled.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.7.3, the MASTER_SSL=1 is prescriptive, not advisory. When\ngiven, the slave connection to the master must use SSL or the\nconnection attempt fails. Before 5.7.3, an SSL connection is permitted\nbut not required. This is analogous to the client-side meaning of the\n--ssl command-line option; see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/secure-connection-options.html.\n\nThe MASTER_TLS_VERSION option specifies the encryption protocols\npermitted by the master for slave connections. The value is like that\nfor the tls_version system variable: A comma-separated list containing\none or more protocol names. The protocols that can be named for this\noption depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL. For details,\nsee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/secure-connection-protocols-ciph\ners.html. This option was added in MySQL 5.7.10.\n\nMASTER_CONNECT_RETRY specifies how many seconds to wait between connect\nretries. The default is 60.\n\nMASTER_RETRY_COUNT limits the number of reconnection attempts and\nupdates the value of the Master_Retry_Count column in the output of\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS. The default value is 24 * 3600 = 86400.\nMASTER_RETRY_COUNT is intended to replace the older\n--master-retry-count server option, and is now the preferred method for\nsetting this limit. You are encouraged not to rely on\n--master-retry-count in new applications and, when upgrading to MySQL\n5.7, to update any existing applications that rely on it, so that they\nuse CHANGE MASTER TO ... MASTER_RETRY_COUNT instead.\n\nMASTER_DELAY specifies how many seconds behind the master the slave\nmust lag. An event received from the master is not executed until at\nleast interval seconds later than its execution on the master. The\ndefault is 0. An error occurs if interval is not a nonnegative integer\nin the range from 0 to 231−1. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-delayed.html.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7.4 and later, a CHANGE MASTER TO statement employing the\nMASTER_DELAY option can be executed on a running slave when the slave\nSQL thread is stopped.\n\nMASTER_BIND is for use on replication slaves having multiple network\ninterfaces, and determines which of the slave\'s network interfaces is\nchosen for connecting to the master.\n\nThe address configured with this option, if any, can be seen in the\nMaster_Bind column of the output from SHOW SLAVE STATUS. If you are\nusing slave status log tables (server started with\n--master-info-repository=TABLE), the value can also be seen as the\nMaster_bind column of the mysql.slave_master_info table.\n\nThe ability to bind a replication slave to a specific network interface\nis also supported by MySQL Cluster.\n\nMASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD sets the interval in seconds between\nreplication heartbeats. Whenever the master\'s binary log is updated\nwith an event, the waiting period for the next heartbeat is reset.\ninterval is a decimal value having the range 0 to 4294967 seconds and a\nresolution in milliseconds; the smallest nonzero value is 0.001.\nHeartbeats are sent by the master only if there are no unsent events in\nthe binary log file for a period longer than interval.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.4, not including MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD caused\nCHANGE MASTER TO to reset the heartbeat period (Slave_heartbeat_period)\nto the default, and Slave_received_heartbeats to 0. (Bug #18185490)\n\nIf you are logging master connection information to tables,\nMASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD can be seen as the value of the Heartbeat\ncolumn of the mysql.slave_master_info table.\n\nSetting interval to 0 disables heartbeats altogether. The default value\nfor interval is equal to the value of slave_net_timeout divided by 2.\n\nSetting @@global.slave_net_timeout to a value less than that of the\ncurrent heartbeat interval results in a warning being issued. The\neffect of issuing RESET SLAVE on the heartbeat interval is to reset it\nto the default value.\n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates at which the\nslave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the next time the\nthread starts. RELAY_LOG_FILE and RELAY_LOG_POS are the coordinates at\nwhich the slave SQL thread should begin reading from the relay log the\nnext time the thread starts. If you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE\nor MASTER_LOG_POS, you cannot specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS, you also\ncannot specify MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 (described later in this\nsection). If neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS is specified,\nthe slave uses the last coordinates of the slave SQL thread before\nCHANGE MASTER TO was issued. This ensures that there is no\ndiscontinuity in replication, even if the slave SQL thread was late\ncompared to the slave I/O thread, when you merely want to change, say,\nthe password to use.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7.4 and later, a CHANGE MASTER TO statement employing\nRELAY_LOG_FILE, RELAY_LOG_POS, or both options can be executed on a\nrunning slave when the slave SQL thread is stopped.\n\nIf MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 is used with CHANGE MASTER TO, the slave\nattempts to connect to the master using the GTID-based replication\nprotocol. In MySQL 5.7.4 and later, this option can be employed by\nCHANGE MASTER TO only if both the slave SQL and slave I/O threads are\nstopped.\n\nWhen using GTIDs, the slave tells the master which transactions it has\nalready received, executed, or both. To compute this set, it reads the\nglobal value of gtid_executed and the value of the Retrieved_gtid_set\ncolumn from SHOW SLAVE STATUS. The GTID of the last transmitted\ntransaction is included in Retrieved_gtid_set only when the full\ntransaction is received. The slave computes the following set:\n\nUNION(@@global.gtid_executed, Retrieved_gtid_set)\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.5, the GTID of the last transmitted transaction was\nincluded in Retrieved_gtid_set even if the transaction was only\npartially transmitted, and the last received GTID was subtracted from\nthis set. (Bug #17943188) Thus, the slave computed the following set:\n\nUNION(@@global.gtid_executed, Retrieved_gtid_set - last_received_GTID)\n\nThis set is sent to the master as part of the initial handshake, and\nthe master sends back all transactions that it has executed which are\nnot part of the set. If any of these transactions have been already\npurged from the master\'s binary log, the master sends the error\nER_MASTER_HAS_PURGED_REQUIRED_GTIDS to the slave, and replication does\nnot start.\n\nWhen GTID-based replication is employed, the coordinates represented by\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are not used, and global transaction\nidentifiers are used instead. Thus the use of either or both of these\noptions together with MASTER_AUTO_POSITION causes an error.\n\nBeginning with MySQL 5.7.1, you can see whether replication is running\nwith autopositioning enabled by checking the output of SHOW SLAVE\nSTATUS. (Bug #15992220)\n\ngtid_mode must also be enabled before issuing CHANGE MASTER TO ...\nMASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1. Otherwise, the statement fails with an error.\n\nTo revert to the older file-based replication protocol after using\nGTIDs, you can issue a new CHANGE MASTER TO statement that specifies\nMASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 0, as well as at least one of MASTER_LOG_FILE or\nMASTER_LOG_POS.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.4, CHANGE MASTER TO deletes all relay log files and\nstarts a new one, unless you specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS.\nIn that case, relay log files are kept; the relay_log_purge global\nvariable is set silently to 0. In MySQL 5.7.4 and later, relay logs are\npreserved when neither the slave SQL thread nor the slave I/O thread is\nstopped; if both threads are stopped, all relay log files are deleted\nunless you at least one of RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS is\nspecified.\n\nRELAY_LOG_FILE can use either an absolute or relative path, and uses\nthe same base name as MASTER_LOG_FILE. (Bug #12190)\n\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS takes a comma-separated list of 0 or more server IDs.\nEvents originating from the corresponding servers are ignored, with the\nexception of log rotation and deletion events, which are still recorded\nin the relay log.\n\nIn circular replication, the originating server normally acts as the\nterminator of its own events, so that they are not applied more than\nonce. Thus, this option is useful in circular replication when one of\nthe servers in the circle is removed. Suppose that you have a circular\nreplication setup with 4 servers, having server IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and\nserver 3 fails. When bridging the gap by starting replication from\nserver 2 to server 4, you can include IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (3) in the\nCHANGE MASTER TO statement that you issue on server 4 to tell it to use\nserver 2 as its master instead of server 3. Doing so causes it to\nignore and not to propagate any statements that originated with the\nserver that is no longer in use.\n\nIf a CHANGE MASTER TO statement is issued without any IGNORE_SERVER_IDS\noption, any existing list is preserved. To clear the list of ignored\nservers, it is necessary to use the option with an empty list:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = ();\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.5, RESET SLAVE ALL has no effect on the server ID\nlist. In MySQL 5.7.5 and later, RESET SLAVE ALL clears\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS. (Bug #18816897)\n\nIf IGNORE_SERVER_IDS contains the server\'s own ID and the server was\nstarted with the --replicate-same-server-id option enabled, an error\nresults.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7, the master info repository and the output of SHOW SLAVE\nSTATUS provide the list of servers that are currently ignored. For more\ninformation, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slave-logs-status.html, and\n[HELP SHOW SLAVE STATUS].\n\nIn MySQL 5.7, invoking CHANGE MASTER TO causes the previous values for\nMASTER_HOST, MASTER_PORT, MASTER_LOG_FILE, and MASTER_LOG_POS to be\nwritten to the error log, along with other information about the\nslave\'s state prior to execution.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7, CHANGE MASTER TO causes an implicit commit of an ongoing\ntransaction. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7.4 and later, the strict requirement to execute STOP SLAVE\nprior to issuing any CHANGE MASTER TO statement (and START SLAVE\nafterward) is removed. Instead of depending on whether the slave is\nstopped, the behavior of CHANGE MASTER TO depends (in MySQL 5.7.4 and\nlater) on the states of the slave SQL thread and slave I/O threads;\nwhich of these threads is stopped or running now determines the options\nthat can or cannot be used with a CHANGE MASTER TO statement at a given\npoint in time. The rules for making this determination are listed here:\n\no If the SQL thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE MASTER TO using\n  any combination that is otherwise allowed of RELAY_LOG_FILE,\n  RELAY_LOG_POS, and MASTER_DELAY options, even if the slave I/O thread\n  is running. No other options may be used with this statement when the\n  I/O thread is running.\n\no If the I/O thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE MASTER TO using\n  any of the options for this statement (in any allowed combination)\n  except RELAY_LOG_FILE, RELAY_LOG_POS, or MASTER_DELAY, even when the\n  SQL thread is running. These three options may not be used when the\n  I/O thread is running.\n\no Both the SQL thread and the I/O thread must be stopped before issuing\n  a CHANGE MASTER TO statement that employs MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1.\n\nYou can check the current state of the slave SQL and I/O threads using\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS.\n\nFor more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-solutions-switch.htm\nl.\n\nIf you are using statement-based replication and temporary tables, it\nis possible for a CHANGE MASTER TO statement following a STOP SLAVE\nstatement to leave behind temporary tables on the slave. In MySQL 5.7.4\nand later, a warning (ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO) is now\nissued whenever this occurs. You can avoid this in such cases by making\nsure that the value of the Slave_open_temp_tables system status\nvariable is equal to 0 prior to executing such a CHANGE MASTER TO\nstatement.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO is useful for setting up a slave when you have the\nsnapshot of the master and have recorded the master binary log\ncoordinates corresponding to the time of the snapshot. After loading\nthe snapshot into the slave to synchronize it with the master, you can\nrun CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'log_name\', MASTER_LOG_POS=log_pos\non the slave to specify the coordinates at which the slave should begin\nreading the master binary log.\n\nThe following example changes the master server the slave uses and\nestablishes the master binary log coordinates from which the slave\nbegins reading. This is used when you want to set up the slave to\nreplicate the master:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  MASTER_HOST=\'master2.mycompany.com\',\n  MASTER_USER=\'replication\',\n  MASTER_PASSWORD=\'bigs3cret\',\n  MASTER_PORT=3306,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'master2-bin.001\',\n  MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nThe next example shows an operation that is less frequently employed.\nIt is used when the slave has relay log files that you want it to\nexecute again for some reason. To do this, the master need not be\nreachable. You need only use CHANGE MASTER TO and start the SQL thread\n(START SLAVE SQL_THREAD):\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  RELAY_LOG_FILE=\'slave-relay-bin.006\',\n  RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-master-to.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-master-to.html'),(433,'TIMESTAMP FUNCTION',32,'Syntax:\nTIMESTAMP(expr), TIMESTAMP(expr1,expr2)\n\nWith a single argument, this function returns the date or datetime\nexpression expr as a datetime value.

It differs from DELETE in the\nfollowing ways in MySQL 5.7:\n\no Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, which is much\n  faster than deleting rows one by one, particularly for large tables.\n\no Truncate operations cause an implicit commit, and so cannot be rolled\n  back.\n\no Truncation operations cannot be performed if the session holds an\n  active table lock.\n\no TRUNCATE TABLE fails for an InnoDB table or NDB table if there are\n  any FOREIGN KEY constraints from other tables that reference the\n  table.

The I/O thread reads events from the master server and stores\nthem in the relay log. The SQL thread reads events from the relay log\nand executes them. START SLAVE requires the SUPER privilege.\n\nIf START SLAVE succeeds in starting the slave threads, it returns\nwithout any error. However, even in that case, it might be that the\nslave threads start and then later stop (for example, because they do\nnot manage to connect to the master or read its binary log, or some\nother problem). START SLAVE does not warn you about this. You must\ncheck the slave\'s error log for error messages generated by the slave\nthreads, or check that they are running satisfactorily with SHOW SLAVE\nSTATUS.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7, START SLAVE causes an implicit commit of an ongoing\ntransaction. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\nBeginning with MySQL 5.7.1, gtid_next must be set to AUTOMATIC before\nissuing this statement (Bug #16062608).\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause added in MySQL 5.7.6 enables\nyou to choose which replication channel the statement applies to. If no\nclause is set and no extra channels exist, the statement applies to the\ndefault channel and behaves the same as versions of MySQL prior to\n5.7.6. Providing a FOR CHANNEL channel clause applies the START SLAVE\nstatement to a specific replication channel. If a START SLAVE statement\ndoes not have a channel defined when using multiple channels, this\nstatement starts the specified threads for all channels. Beginning with\nMySQL 5.7.9, this statement is disallowed for the\ngroup_replication_recovery channel. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nMySQL 5.7 supports pluggable user-password authentication with START\nSLAVE with the USER, PASSWORD, DEFAULT_AUTH and PLUGIN_DIR options, as\ndescribed in the following list:\n\no USER: User name. Cannot be set to an empty or null string, or left\n  unset if PASSWORD is used.\n\no PASSWORD: Password.\n\no DEFAULT_AUTH: Name of plugin; default is MySQL native authentication.\n\no PLUGIN_DIR: Location of plugin.\n\nYou cannot use the SQL_THREAD option when specifying any of USER,\nPASSWORD, DEFAULT_AUTH, or PLUGIN_DIR, unless the IO_THREAD option is\nalso provided.\n\nSee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/pluggable-authentication.html,\nfor more information.\n\nIf an insecure connection is used with any these options, the server\nissues the warning Sending passwords in plain text without SSL/TLS is\nextremely insecure.\n\nSTART SLAVE ... UNTIL supports two additional options for use with\nglobal transaction identifiers (GTIDs) (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids.html). Each of\nthese takes a set of one or more global transaction identifiers\ngtid_set as an argument (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-concepts.html#\nreplication-gtids-concepts-gtid-sets, for more information).\n\nWhen no thread_type is specified, START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS\ncauses the slave SQL thread to process transactions until it has\nreached the first transaction whose GTID is listed in the gtid_set.\nSTART SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS causes the slave threads to process\nall transactions until the last transaction in the gtid_set has been\nprocessed by both threads. In other words, START SLAVE UNTIL\nSQL_BEFORE_GTIDS causes the slave SQL thread to process all\ntransactions occurring before the first GTID in the gtid_set is\nreached, and START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS causes the slave threads\nto handle all transactions, including those whose GTIDs are found in\ngtid_set, until each has encountered a transaction whose GTID is not\npart of the set. SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS and SQL_AFTER_GTIDS each support the\nSQL_THREAD and IO_THREAD options, although using IO_THREAD with them\ncurrently has no effect.\n\nFor example, START SLAVE SQL_THREAD UNTIL SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS =\n3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:11-56 causes the slave SQL thread\nto process all transactions originating from the master whose\nserver_uuid is 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 until it encounters\nthe transaction having sequence number 11; it then stops without\nprocessing this transaction. In other words, all transactions up to and\nincluding the transaction with sequence number 10 are processed.\nExecuting START SLAVE SQL_THREAD UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS =\n3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:11-56, on the other hand, would\ncause the slave SQL thread to obtain all transactions just mentioned\nfrom the master, including all of the transactions having the sequence\nnumbers 11 through 56, and then to stop without processing any\nadditional transactions; that is, the transaction having sequence\nnumber 56 would be the last transaction fetched by the slave SQL\nthread.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.3, SQL_AFTER_GTIDS did not stop the slave once the\nindicated transaction was completed, but waited until another GTID\nevent was received (Bug #14767986).\n\nWhen using a multi-threaded slave, there is a chance of gaps in the\nsequence of transactions that have been executed from the relay log in\nthe following cases:\n\no killing the coordinator thread\n\no after an error occurs in the worker threads\n\no mysqld shuts down unexpectedly\n\nUse the START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS statement to cause a\nmulti-threaded slave\'s worker threads to only run until no more gaps\nare found in the relay log, and then to stop. This statement can take\nan SQL_THREAD option, but the effects of the statement remain\nunchanged. It has no effect on the slave I/O thread (and cannot be used\nwith the IO_THREAD option).\n\nIssuing START SLAVE on a multi-threaded slave with gaps in the sequence\nof transactions executed from the relay log generates a warning. In\nsuch a situation, the solution is to use START SLAVE UNTIL\nSQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS, then issue RESET SLAVE to remove any remaining\nrelay logs. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-features-transaction\n-inconsistencies.html for more information.\n\nTo change a failed multi-threaded slave to single-threaded mode, you\ncan issue the following series of statements, in the order shown:\n\nSTART SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS;\n\nSET @@GLOBAL.slave_parallel_workers = 0;\n\nSTART SLAVE SQL_THREAD;\n\n*Note*:\n\nIt is possible to view the entire text of a running START SLAVE ...\nstatement, including any USER or PASSWORD values used, in the output of\nSHOW PROCESSLIST.

The line number is specific to your version of\n  MySQL. As of MySQL 5.7.8, only the mutex name is reported. File name\n  and line number are still reported for rwlocks.\n\no Status\n\n  The mutex status.\n\n  Prior to MySQL 5.7.8, the Status field displays several values if\n  WITH_DEBUG was defined at MySQL compilation time. If WITH_DEBUG was\n  not defined, the statement displays only the os_waits value. In the\n  latter case (without WITH_DEBUG), the information on which the output\n  is based is insufficient to distinguish regular mutexes and mutexes\n  that protect rwlocks (which permit multiple readers or a single\n  writer). Consequently, the output may appear to contain multiple rows\n  for the same mutex. Pre-MySQL 5.7.8 Status field values include:\n\n  o count indicates how many times the mutex was requested.\n\n  o spin_waits indicates how many times the spinlock had to run.\n\n  o spin_rounds indicates the number of spinlock rounds. (spin_rounds\n    divided by spin_waits provides the average round count.)\n\n  o os_waits indicates the number of operating system waits. This\n    occurs when the spinlock did not work (the mutex was not locked\n    during the spinlock and it was necessary to yield to the operating\n    system and wait).\n\n  o os_yields indicates the number of times a thread trying to lock a\n    mutex gave up its timeslice and yielded to the operating system (on\n    the presumption that permitting other threads to run will free the\n    mutex so that it can be locked).\n\n  o os_wait_times indicates the amount of time (in ms) spent in\n    operating system waits. In MySQL 5.7 timing is disabled and this\n    value is always 0.\n\n  As of MySQL 5.7.8, the Status field reports the number of spins,\n  waits, and calls. Statistics for low-level operating system mutexes,\n  which are implemented outside of InnoDB, are not reported.\n\n  o spins indicates the number of spins.\n\n  o waits indicates the number of mutex waits.\n\n  o calls indicates how many times the mutex was requested.\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX skips the mutexes and rw-locks of buffer pool\nblocks, as the amount of output can be overwhelming on systems with a\nlarge buffer pool. (There is one mutex and one rw-lock in each 16K\nbuffer pool block, and there are 65,536 blocks per gigabyte.) SHOW\nENGINE INNODB MUTEX also does not list any mutexes or rw-locks that\nhave never been waited on (os_waits=0). Thus, SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX\nonly displays information about mutexes and rw-locks outside of the\nbuffer pool that have caused at least one OS-level wait.\n\nUse SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS to inspect the internal\noperation of the Performance Schema code:\n\nmysql> SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS\\G\n...\n*************************** 3. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.size\nStatus: 76\n*************************** 4. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.count\nStatus: 10000\n*************************** 5. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.memory\nStatus: 760000\n...\n*************************** 57. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: performance_schema.memory\nStatus: 26459600\n...\n\nThis statement is intended to help the DBA understand the effects that\ndifferent Performance Schema options have on memory requirements.\n\nName values consist of two parts, which name an internal buffer and a\nbuffer attribute, respectively. Interpret buffer names as follows:\n\no An internal buffer that is not exposed as a table is named within\n  parentheses. Examples: (pfs_cond_class).size,\n  (pfs_mutex_class).memory.\n\no An internal buffer that is exposed as a table in the\n  performance_schema database is named after the table, without\n  parentheses. Examples: events_waits_history.size,\n  mutex_instances.count.\n\no A value that applies to the Performance Schema as a whole begins with\n  performance_schema. Example: performance_schema.memory.\n\nBuffer attributes have these meanings:\n\no size is the size of the internal record used by the implementation,\n  such as the size of a row in a table. size values cannot be changed.\n\no count is the number of internal records, such as the number of rows\n  in a table. count values can be changed using Performance Schema\n  configuration options.\n\no For a table, tbl_name.memory is the product of size and count. For\n  the Performance Schema as a whole, performance_schema.memory is the\n  sum of all the memory used (the sum of all other memory values).\n\nSome size and count attributes were named row_size and row_count before\nMySQL 5.7.1.\n\nIn some cases, there is a direct relationship between a Performance\nSchema configuration parameter and a SHOW ENGINE value. For example,\nevents_waits_history_long.count corresponds to\nperformance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size. In other cases, the\nrelationship is more complex. For example, events_waits_history.count\ncorresponds to performance_schema_events_waits_history_size (the number\nof rows per thread) multiplied by\nperformance_schema_max_thread_instances ( the number of threads).\n\nSHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS If the server has the NDB storage engine\nenabled, SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS displays cluster status information\nsuch as the number of connected data nodes, the cluster connectstring,\nand cluster binary log epochs, as well as counts of various Cluster API\nobjects created by the MySQL Server when connected to the cluster.\nSample output from this statement is shown here:\n\nmysql> SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS;\n+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n| Type       | Name                  | Status                                           |\n+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n| ndbcluster | connection            | cluster_node_id=7,\n  connected_host=192.168.0.103, connected_port=1186, number_of_data_nodes=4,\n  number_of_ready_data_nodes=3, connect_count=0                                         |\n| ndbcluster | NdbTransaction        | created=6, free=0, sizeof=212                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbOperation          | created=8, free=8, sizeof=660                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbIndexScanOperation | created=1, free=1, sizeof=744                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbIndexOperation     | created=0, free=0, sizeof=664                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbRecAttr            | created=1285, free=1285, sizeof=60               |\n| ndbcluster | NdbApiSignal          | created=16, free=16, sizeof=136                  |\n| ndbcluster | NdbLabel              | created=0, free=0, sizeof=196                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbBranch             | created=0, free=0, sizeof=24                     |\n| ndbcluster | NdbSubroutine         | created=0, free=0, sizeof=68                     |\n| ndbcluster | NdbCall               | created=0, free=0, sizeof=16                     |\n| ndbcluster | NdbBlob               | created=1, free=1, sizeof=264                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbReceiver           | created=4, free=0, sizeof=68                     |\n| ndbcluster | binlog                | latest_epoch=155467, latest_trans_epoch=148126,\n  latest_received_binlog_epoch=0, latest_handled_binlog_epoch=0,\n  latest_applied_binlog_epoch=0                                                         |\n+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe Status column in each of these rows provides information about the\nMySQL server\'s connection to the cluster and about the cluster binary\nlog\'s status, respectively.

More details are given in\nthe discussion following the list.\n\no str: The input string expression.\n\no AS clause: Optional; cast the input string to a given type and\n  length.\n\no LEVEL clause: Optional; specify weight levels for the return value.\n\no flags: Optional; unused.\n\nThe input string, str, is a string expression. If the input is a\nnonbinary (character) string such as a CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT value,\nthe return value contains the collation weights for the string. If the\ninput is a binary (byte) string such as a BINARY, VARBINARY, or BLOB\nvalue, the return value is the same as the input (the weight for each\nbyte in a binary string is the byte value). If the input is NULL,\nWEIGHT_STRING() returns NULL.\n\nExamples:\n\nmysql> SET @s = _latin1 \'AB\' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| AB   | 4142    | 4142                   |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\nmysql> SET @s = _latin1 \'ab\' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| ab   | 6162    | 4142                   |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\nmysql> SET @s = CAST(\'AB\' AS BINARY);\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| AB   | 4142    | 4142                   |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\nmysql> SET @s = CAST(\'ab\' AS BINARY);\nmysql> SELECT @s, HEX(@s), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s));\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| @s   | HEX(@s) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(@s)) |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n| ab   | 6162    | 6162                   |\n+------+---------+------------------------+\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html'),(565,'ST_EQUALS',31,'ST_Equals(g1, g2)\n\nReturns 1 or 0 to indicate whether g1 is spatially equal to g2.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html\n\n','mysql> SET @g1 = Point(1,1), @g2 = Point(2,2);\nmysql> SELECT ST_Equals(@g1, @g1), ST_Equals(@g1, @g2);\n+---------------------+---------------------+\n| ST_Equals(@g1, @g1) | ST_Equals(@g1, @g2) |\n+---------------------+---------------------+\n|                   1 |                   0 |\n+---------------------+---------------------+\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html'),(566,'ALTER EVENT',40,'Syntax:\nALTER\n    [DEFINER = { user | CURRENT_USER }]\n    EVENT event_name\n    [ON SCHEDULE schedule]\n    [ON COMPLETION [NOT] PRESERVE]\n    [RENAME TO new_event_name]\n    [ENABLE | DISABLE | DISABLE ON SLAVE]\n    [COMMENT \'comment\']\n    [DO event_body]\n\nThe ALTER EVENT statement changes one or more of the characteristics of\nan existing event without the need to drop and recreate it.

It requires the INSERT\nprivilege for the mysql.plugin system table.\n\nplugin_name is the name of the plugin as defined in the plugin\ndescriptor structure contained in the library file (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/plugin-data-structures.html).\nPlugin names are not case sensitive. For maximal compatibility, plugin\nnames should be limited to ASCII letters, digits, and underscore\nbecause they are used in C source files, shell command lines, M4 and\nBourne shell scripts, and SQL environments.\n\nshared_library_name is the name of the shared library that contains the\nplugin code. The name includes the file name extension (for example,\nlibmyplugin.so, libmyplugin.dll, or libmyplugin.dylib).\n\nThe shared library must be located in the plugin directory (the\ndirectory named by the plugin_dir system variable). The library must be\nin the plugin directory itself, not in a subdirectory. By default,\nplugin_dir is the plugin directory under the directory named by the\npkglibdir configuration variable, but it can be changed by setting the\nvalue of plugin_dir at server startup. For example, set its value in a\nmy.cnf file:\n\n[mysqld]\nplugin_dir=/path/to/plugin/directory\n\nIf the value of plugin_dir is a relative path name, it is taken to be\nrelative to the MySQL base directory (the value of the basedir system\nvariable).\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN loads and initializes the plugin code to make the plugin\navailable for use. A plugin is initialized by executing its\ninitialization function, which handles any setup that the plugin must\nperform before it can be used. When the server shuts down, it executes\nthe deinitialization function for each plugin that is loaded so that\nthe plugin has a chance to perform any final cleanup.\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN also registers the plugin by adding a line that\nindicates the plugin name and library file name to the mysql.plugin\ntable. At server startup, the server loads and initializes any plugin\nthat is listed in the mysql.plugin table. This means that a plugin is\ninstalled with INSTALL PLUGIN only once, not every time the server\nstarts. Plugin loading at startup does not occur if the server is\nstarted with the --skip-grant-tables option.\n\nA plugin library can contain multiple plugins. For each of them to be\ninstalled, use a separate INSTALL PLUGIN statement. Each statement\nnames a different plugin, but all of them specify the same library\nname.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/install-plugin.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/install-plugin.html'),(577,'DECLARE CURSOR',24,'Syntax:\nDECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement\n\nThis statement declares a cursor and associates it with a SELECT\nstatement that retrieves the rows to be traversed by the cursor.

LOAD DATA INFILE is the complement of SELECT ...\nINTO OUTFILE. (See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select-into.html.) To write data\nfrom a table to a file, use SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE. To read the file\nback into a table, use LOAD DATA INFILE. The syntax of the FIELDS and\nLINES clauses is the same for both statements. Both clauses are\noptional, but FIELDS must precede LINES if both are specified.\n\nYou can also load data files by using the mysqlimport utility; it\noperates by sending a LOAD DATA INFILE statement to the server. The\n--local option causes mysqlimport to read data files from the client\nhost. You can specify the --compress option to get better performance\nover slow networks if the client and server support the compressed\nprotocol. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqlimport.html.\n\nFor more information about the efficiency of INSERT versus LOAD DATA\nINFILE and speeding up LOAD DATA INFILE, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-optimization.html.\n\nThe file name must be given as a literal string. On Windows, specify\nbackslashes in path names as forward slashes or doubled backslashes.\nThe character_set_filesystem system variable controls the\ninterpretation of the file name.\n\nLOAD DATA supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION\noption with a comma-separated list of one or more names of partitions,\nsubpartitions, or both. When this option is used, if any rows from the\nfile cannot be inserted into any of the partitions or subpartitions\nnamed in the list, the statement fails with the error Found a row not\nmatching the given partition set. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-selection.html.\n\nFor partitioned tables using storage engines that employ table locks,\nsuch as MyISAM, LOAD DATA cannot prune any partition locks. This does\nnot apply to tables using storage engines which employ row-level\nlocking, such as InnoDB. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-limitations-locking\n.html.\n\nThe server uses the character set indicated by the\ncharacter_set_database system variable to interpret the information in\nthe file. SET NAMES and the setting of character_set_client do not\naffect interpretation of input. If the contents of the input file use a\ncharacter set that differs from the default, it is usually preferable\nto specify the character set of the file by using the CHARACTER SET\nclause. A character set of binary specifies \"no conversion.\"\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE interprets all fields in the file as having the same\ncharacter set, regardless of the data types of the columns into which\nfield values are loaded. For proper interpretation of file contents,\nyou must ensure that it was written with the correct character set. For\nexample, if you write a data file with mysqldump -T or by issuing a\nSELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statement in mysql, be sure to use a\n--default-character-set option so that output is written in the\ncharacter set to be used when the file is loaded with LOAD DATA INFILE.\n\n*Note*:\n\nIt is not possible to load data files that use the ucs2, utf16,\nutf16le, or utf32 character set.\n\nIf you use LOW_PRIORITY, execution of the LOAD DATA statement is\ndelayed until no other clients are reading from the table. This affects\nonly storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM,\nMEMORY, and MERGE).\n\nIf you specify CONCURRENT with a MyISAM table that satisfies the\ncondition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free blocks\nin the middle), other threads can retrieve data from the table while\nLOAD DATA is executing. This option affects the performance of LOAD\nDATA a bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same\ntime.\n\nWith row-based replication, CONCURRENT is replicated regardless of\nMySQL version. With statement-based replication CONCURRENT is not\nreplicated prior to MySQL 5.5.1 (see Bug #34628). For more information,\nsee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-features-load-data.h\ntml.\n\nThe LOCAL keyword affects expected location of the file and error\nhandling, as described later. LOCAL works only if your server and your\nclient both have been configured to permit it. For example, if mysqld\nwas started with --local-infile=0, LOCAL does not work. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data-local.html.\n\nThe LOCAL keyword affects where the file is expected to be found:\n\no If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the\n  client host and sent to the server. The file can be given as a full\n  path name to specify its exact location. If given as a relative path\n  name, the name is interpreted relative to the directory in which the\n  client program was started.\n\n  When using LOCAL with LOAD DATA, a copy of the file is created in the\n  server\'s temporary directory. This is not the directory determined by\n  the value of tmpdir or slave_load_tmpdir, but rather the operating\n  system\'s temporary directory, and is not configurable in the MySQL\n  Server. (Typically the system temporary directory is /tmp on Linux\n  systems and C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP on Windows.) Lack of sufficient space for\n  the copy in this directory can cause the LOAD DATA LOCAL statement to\n  fail.\n\no If LOCAL is not specified, the file must be located on the server\n  host and is read directly by the server. The server uses the\n  following rules to locate the file:\n\n  o If the file name is an absolute path name, the server uses it as\n    given.\n\n  o If the file name is a relative path name with one or more leading\n    components, the server searches for the file relative to the\n    server\'s data directory.\n\n  o If a file name with no leading components is given, the server\n    looks for the file in the database directory of the default\n    database.\n\nIn the non-LOCAL case, these rules mean that a file named as\n./myfile.txt is read from the server\'s data directory, whereas the file\nnamed as myfile.txt is read from the database directory of the default\ndatabase. For example, if db1 is the default database, the following\nLOAD DATA statement reads the file data.txt from the database directory\nfor db1, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a\ntable in the db2 database:\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE \'data.txt\' INTO TABLE db2.my_table;\n\nFor security reasons, when reading text files located on the server,\nthe files must either reside in the database directory or be readable\nby the user account used to run the server. Also, to use LOAD DATA\nINFILE on server files, you must have the FILE privilege. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html. For\nnon-LOCAL load operations, if the secure_file_priv system variable is\nset to a nonempty directory name, the file to be loaded must be located\nin that directory.\n\nUsing LOCAL is a bit slower than letting the server access the files\ndirectly, because the contents of the file must be sent over the\nconnection by the client to the server. On the other hand, you do not\nneed the FILE privilege to load local files.\n\nLOCAL also affects error handling:\n\no With LOAD DATA INFILE, data-interpretation and duplicate-key errors\n  terminate the operation.\n\no With LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE, data-interpretation and duplicate-key\n  errors become warnings and the operation continues because the server\n  has no way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the\n  operation. For duplicate-key errors, this is the same as if IGNORE is\n  specified. IGNORE is explained further later in this section.\n\nThe REPLACE and IGNORE keywords control handling of input rows that\nduplicate existing rows on unique key values:\n\no If you specify REPLACE, input rows replace existing rows. In other\n  words, rows that have the same value for a primary key or unique\n  index as an existing row. See [HELP REPLACE].\n\no If you specify IGNORE, rows that duplicate an existing row on a\n  unique key value are discarded. For more information, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#ignore-strict-co\n  mparison.\n\no If you do not specify either option, the behavior depends on whether\n  the LOCAL keyword is specified. Without LOCAL, an error occurs when a\n  duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text file is\n  ignored. With LOCAL, the default behavior is the same as if IGNORE is\n  specified; this is because the server has no way to stop transmission\n  of the file in the middle of the operation.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html'),(579,'LOCALTIME',32,'Syntax:\nLOCALTIME, LOCALTIME([fsp])\n\nLOCALTIME and LOCALTIME() are synonyms for NOW().\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html'),(580,'ST_GEOMFROMWKB',33,'ST_GeomFromWKB(wkb[, srid]), ST_GeometryFromWKB(wkb[, srid])\n\nConstructs a geometry value of any type using its WKB representation\nand SRID.\n\nThe result is NULL if the WKB or SRID argument is NULL.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/gis-wkb-functions.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/gis-wkb-functions.html'),(581,'SHA1',12,'Syntax:\nSHA1(str), SHA(str)\n\nCalculates an SHA-1 160-bit checksum for the string, as described in\nRFC 3174 (Secure Hash Algorithm).

An xid is an XA transaction identifier. It indicates\nwhich transaction the statement applies to. xid values are supplied by\nthe client, or generated by the MySQL server. An xid value has from one\nto three parts:\n\nxid: gtrid [, bqual [, formatID ]]\n\ngtrid is a global transaction identifier, bqual is a branch qualifier,\nand formatID is a number that identifies the format used by the gtrid\nand bqual values. As indicated by the syntax, bqual and formatID are\noptional. The default bqual value is \'\' if not given. The default\nformatID value is 1 if not given.\n\ngtrid and bqual must be string literals, each up to 64 bytes (not\ncharacters) long. gtrid and bqual can be specified in several ways. You\ncan use a quoted string (\'ab\'), hex string (X\'6162\', 0x6162), or bit\nvalue (b\'nnnn\').\n\nformatID is an unsigned integer.\n\nThe gtrid and bqual values are interpreted in bytes by the MySQL\nserver\'s underlying XA support routines. However, while an SQL\nstatement containing an XA statement is being parsed, the server works\nwith some specific character set. To be safe, write gtrid and bqual as\nhex strings.\n\nxid values typically are generated by the Transaction Manager. Values\ngenerated by one TM must be different from values generated by other\nTMs. A given TM must be able to recognize its own xid values in a list\nof values returned by the XA RECOVER statement.\n\nFor XA START xid starts an XA transaction with the given xid value.\nEach XA transaction must have a unique xid value, so the value must not\ncurrently be used by another XA transaction. Uniqueness is assessed\nusing the gtrid and bqual values. All following XA statements for the\nXA transaction must be specified using the same xid value as that given\nin the XA START statement. If you use any of those statements but\nspecify an xid value that does not correspond to some existing XA\ntransaction, an error occurs.\n\nOne or more XA transactions can be part of the same global transaction.\nAll XA transactions within a given global transaction must use the same\ngtrid value in the xid value. For this reason, gtrid values must be\nglobally unique so that there is no ambiguity about which global\ntransaction a given XA transaction is part of. The bqual part of the\nxid value must be different for each XA transaction within a global\ntransaction. (The requirement that bqual values be different is a\nlimitation of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of\nthe XA specification.)\n\nThe XA RECOVER statement returns information for those XA transactions\non the MySQL server that are in the PREPARED state. (See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa-states.html.) The output\nincludes a row for each such XA transaction on the server, regardless\nof which client started it.\n\nXA RECOVER output rows look like this (for an example xid value\nconsisting of the parts \'abc\', \'def\', and 7):\n\nmysql> XA RECOVER;\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n| formatID | gtrid_length | bqual_length | data   |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n|        7 |            3 |            3 | abcdef |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n\nThe output columns have the following meanings:\n\no formatID is the formatID part of the transaction xid\n\no gtrid_length is the length in bytes of the gtrid part of the xid\n\no bqual_length is the length in bytes of the bqual part of the xid\n\no data is the concatenation of the gtrid and bqual parts of the xid\n\nXID values may contain nonprintable characters.

By default these functions implement AES with a 128-bit key\nlength. As of MySQL 5.7.4, key lengths of 196 or 256 bits can be used,\nas described later. The key length is a trade off between performance\nand security.\n\nAES_ENCRYPT() encrypts the string str using the key string key_str and\nreturns a binary string containing the encrypted output. AES_DECRYPT()\ndecrypts the encrypted string crypt_str using the key string key_str\nand returns the original cleartext string. If either function argument\nis NULL, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe str and crypt_str arguments can be any length, and padding is\nautomatically added to str so it is a multiple of a block as required\nby block-based algorithms such as AES. This padding is automatically\nremoved by the AES_DECRYPT() function. The length of crypt_str can be\ncalculated using this formula:\n\n16 * (trunc(string_length / 16) + 1)\n\nFor a key length of 128 bits, the most secure way to pass a key to the\nkey_str argument is to create a truly random 128-bit value and pass it\nas a binary value. For example:\n\nINSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT(\'text\',UNHEX(\'F3229A0B371ED2D9441B830D21A390C3\')));\n\nA passphrase can be used to generate an AES key by hashing the\npassphrase. For example:\n\nINSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT(\'text\', UNHEX(SHA2(\'My secret passphrase\',512))));\n\nDo not pass a password or passphrase directly to crypt_str, hash it\nfirst. Previous versions of this documentation suggested the former\napproach, but it is no longer recommended as the examples shown here\nare more secure.\n\nIf AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid data or incorrect padding, it returns\nNULL. However, it is possible for AES_DECRYPT() to return a non-NULL\nvalue (possibly garbage) if the input data or the key is invalid.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.7.4, AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() permit control of\nthe block encryption mode and take an optional init_vector\ninitialization vector argument:\n\no The block_encryption_mode system variable controls the mode for\n  block-based encryption algorithms. Its default value is aes-128-ecb,\n  which signifies encryption using a key length of 128 bits and ECB\n  mode.

An error occurs if\ninit_vector is missing.\n\nFor modes that do not require init_vector, it is ignored and a warning\nis generated if it is specified.\n\nA random string of bytes to use for the initialization vector can be\nproduced by calling RANDOM_BYTES(16).

If the view does not exist,\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does\nexist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as ALTER VIEW.\n\nFor information about restrictions on view use, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-restrictions.html.\n\nThe select_statement is a SELECT statement that provides the definition\nof the view. (Selecting from the view selects, in effect, using the\nSELECT statement.) The select_statement can select from base tables or\nother views.\n\nThe view definition is \"frozen\" at creation time and is not affected by\nsubsequent changes to the definitions of the underlying tables. For\nexample, if a view is defined as SELECT * on a table, new columns added\nto the table later do not become part of the view, and columns dropped\nfrom the table will result in an error when selecting from the view.\n\nThe ALGORITHM clause affects how MySQL processes the view. The DEFINER\nand SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be used when\nchecking access privileges at view invocation time. The WITH CHECK\nOPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in\ntables referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in\nthis section.\n\nThe CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the\nview, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT\nstatement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement, you must\nhave the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you\nmust also have the DROP privilege for the view. CREATE VIEW might also\nrequire the SUPER privilege, depending on the DEFINER value, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nWhen a view is referenced, privilege checking occurs as described later\nin this section.\n\nA view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the\ndefault database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nuse db_name.view_name syntax to qualify the view name with the database\nname:\n\nCREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are also\ninterpreted with respect to the default database. A view can refer to\ntables or views in other databases by qualifying the table or view name\nwith the appropriate database name.\n\nWithin a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so a\nbase table and a view cannot have the same name.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns, or expressions that use functions, constant values,\noperators, and so forth.\n\nA view must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like a\nbase table. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the\nSELECT statement are used for the view column names. To define explicit\nnames for the view columns, specify the optional column_list clause as\na list of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in\ncolumn_list must be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the\nSELECT statement.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can\nrefer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables:\n\nCREATE VIEW v_today (today) AS SELECT CURRENT_DATE;\n\nThe following example defines a view that selects two columns from\nanother table as well as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\no Before MySQL 5.7.7, the SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in\n  the FROM clause.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to system variables or user-defined\n  variables.\n\no Within a stored program, the SELECT statement cannot refer to program\n  parameters or local variables.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\no Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. If, after\n  the view has been created, a table or view that the definition refers\n  to is dropped, use of the view results in an error. To check a view\n  definition for problems of this kind, use the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\no The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\n  create a TEMPORARY view.\n\no You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\no Aliases for column names in the SELECT statement are checked against\n  the maximum column length of 64 characters (not the maximum alias\n  length of 256 characters).\n\nORDER BY is permitted in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the\neffect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle\napplies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that\nfollow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE,\nLOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.\n\nThe results obtained from a view may be affected if you change the\nquery processing environment by changing system variables:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT \'abc\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'ANSI_QUOTES\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| abc   |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MySQL account to\nuse when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is\nexecuted that references the view. The valid SQL SECURITY\ncharacteristic values are DEFINER (the default) and INVOKER. These\nindicate that the required privileges must be held by the user who\ndefined or invoked the view, respectively.\n\nIf a user value is given for the DEFINER clause, it should be a MySQL\naccount specified as \'user_name\'@\'host_name\', CURRENT_USER, or\nCURRENT_USER(). The default DEFINER value is the user who executes the\nCREATE VIEW statement. This is the same as specifying DEFINER =\nCURRENT_USER explicitly.\n\nIf the DEFINER clause is present, these rules determine the valid\nDEFINER user values:\n\no If you do not have the SUPER privilege, the only valid user value is\n  your own account, either specified literally or by using\n  CURRENT_USER. You cannot set the definer to some other account.\n\no If you have the SUPER privilege, you can specify any syntactically\n  valid account name. If the account does not exist, a warning is\n  generated.\n\no Although it is possible to create a view with a nonexistent DEFINER\n  account, an error occurs when the view is referenced if the SQL\n  SECURITY value is DEFINER but the definer account does not exist.\n\nFor more information about view security, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-programs-security.html.\n\nWithin a view definition, CURRENT_USER returns the view\'s DEFINER value\nby default. For views defined with the SQL SECURITY INVOKER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the account for the view\'s\ninvoker. For information about user auditing within views, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/account-activity-auditing.html.\n\nWithin a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine\'s DEFINER value. This\nalso affects a view defined within such a routine, if the view\ndefinition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.\n\nMySQL checks view privileges like this:\n\no At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges\n  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For\n  example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator\n  must have some privilege for each column in the select list of the\n  definition, and the SELECT privilege for each column used elsewhere\n  in the definition. If the definition refers to a stored function,\n  only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The\n  privileges required at function invocation time can be checked only\n  as it executes: For different invocations, different execution paths\n  within the function might be taken.\n\no The user who references a view must have appropriate privileges to\n  access it (SELECT to select from it, INSERT to insert into it, and so\n  forth.)\n\no When a view has been referenced, privileges for objects accessed by\n  the view are checked against the privileges held by the view DEFINER\n  account or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY\n  characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.\n\no If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function,\n  privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend\n  on whether the function SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or\n  INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs\n  with the privileges of the DEFINER account. If the characteristic is\n  INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the\n  view\'s SQL SECURITY characteristic.\n\nExample: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function\nmight invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view\ninvokes a stored function f():\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);\n\nSuppose that f() contains a statement such as this:\n\nIF name IS NULL then\n  CALL p1();\nELSE\n  CALL p2();\nEND IF;\n\nThe privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be\nchecked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed\nfor p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those\nprivileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess\nthe privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v\nand the function f().\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to\nstandard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for\nSQL SECURITY DEFINER. The standard says that the definer of the view,\nwhich is the same as the owner of the view\'s schema, gets applicable\nprivileges on the view (for example, SELECT) and may grant them. MySQL\nhas no concept of a schema \"owner\", so MySQL adds a clause to identify\nthe definer. The DEFINER clause is an extension where the intent is to\nhave what the standard has; that is, a permanent record of who defined\nthe view. This is why the default DEFINER value is the account of the\nview creator.\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It\naffects how MySQL processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:\nMERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-algorithms.html, as well as\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/derived-table-optimization.html.\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such\nas UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying\ntable. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one\nrelationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the\nunderlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a\nview nonupdatable.\n\nA generated column in a view is considered updatable because it is\npossible to assign to it. However, if such a column is updated\nexplicitly, the only permitted value is DEFAULT. For information about\ngenerated columns, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-generated-columns.h\ntml.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n\nIn a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and\nCASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is\ndefined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the CHECK\nOPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the checks for\nunderlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither keyword is\ngiven, the default is CASCADED.\n\nFor more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION\nclause, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-updatability.html, and\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-check-option.html.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-view.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-view.html'),(602,'TRIM',38,'Syntax:\nTRIM([{BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING} [remstr] FROM] str), TRIM([remstr\nFROM] str)\n\nReturns the string str with all remstr prefixes or suffixes removed.

You may optionally follow size with a\none-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude, similar to those\nused in my.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters M (megabytes) or\nG (gigabytes).\n\n*Note*:\n\nAll MySQL Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This\nmeans that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely\neach Disk Data object of a given type).
